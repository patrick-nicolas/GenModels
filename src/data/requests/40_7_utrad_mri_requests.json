Midline and more proximal femoral involvement has improved over October 27 outside study, however process otherwise has worsened with more pronounced low T1 signal and more complete extension to the end of the bone. There is no appreciable signal dropout on out of phase imaging. Process enhances avidly postcontrast. There is mild surrounding soft tissue edema.\\n\\nSimilar ill-defined focal low T1 high T2 signal process with postcontrast enhancement is seen involving the proximal diametaphyseal tibia about 4 cm distal to the joint. This process however shows dropout of signal on out of phase imaging. Although incompletely imaged on prior study, tibial signal appears to have increased over October outside exam.\\n\\nNo other significant findings. No evidence for sinus tracts, sequestra, fractures, AVN. \\n\\nImpression:\\nAbnormal nonspecific signal in the distal femur has not resolved or improved significantly. Additional similar abnormal signal involving mid tibia, increased over prior exam. EMR indicates January 8 biopsy negative for neoplasm. Etiology otherwise is unclear. Additional differential diagnosis would include CRMO (consider rheumatology referral).

The largest discrete lesion seen on the prior examination located in the left frontal lobe currently measures 2 mm image 120 series 9, previously 4 mm. A left para median parietal lesion measuring approximately 2 mm image 110 series 9 previously measured approximately 4 mm. The largest supratentorial lesion visible on the current study measures approximately 2 to 3 mm on image 125 series 9 and the right parietal lobe, previously measuring approximately 3 to 4 mm. The largest infratentorial lesion visible on the current study measures 4 mm in the right cerebellar hemisphere image 49 series 9, previously 5 mm in a similar plane. No clearly new lesion is identified in the interval from the prior examination.\\n\\nNo pathologic hemosiderin deposition has developed. T2/flair hyperintensities throughout the periventricular and subcortical white matter are otherwise unchanged from the prior examination and are compatible with moderate microangiopathic changes, with no new area of parenchymal edema. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. No evidence of acute infarct on diffusion imaging. There are small volume bilateral mastoid effusions left greater than right. Evidence of prior bilateral ocular lens replacement, with posterior ocular staphylomas. The expected physiologic basilar flow-voids are intact. Presumed Tornwaldt cyst of the posterior nasopharynx is unchanged.\\n\\nImpression:\\n1. Although the current examination is somewhat limited by patient motion which could obscure small lesions, there is appearance of treatment response, with clear decrease in size of the larger lesions visible on the prior study. No new lesion is detected.\\n2. Chronic microangiopathic changes and other chronic abnormality`s are otherwise similar to the prior study.\\n\\nAUR-UTHM-JN\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             02/21/2021 18:19\\n\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Abnormal signal again extends into the leftward posterior elements at these levels. Distribution of the permeative signal abnormality is unchanged from prior MRI. Postoperative changes of C3-C5 laminectomy. Vertebral body heights are well-maintained.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: Significantly decreased size of postsurgical fluid collection within the laminectomy bed now measuring 0.9 x 0.3 cm compared to 3 x 1 cm previously. \\n\\nCanal contents: No significant change in cord deformity and mild displacement to the right related to previously resected meningioma. Increased T2/STIR signal with volume loss presumably representing myelomalacia at the level of C3-C4, similar to prior.\\n\\nNo significant change in confluent, enhancing epidural soft tissue involving the left lateral aspect of the canal extending anteriorly and posteriorly as well as into multiple left neural foramen (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, and partially involving the left C5-C6 and C6-C7). This enhancing soft tissue is again thickest at C3-C4, where there is persistent moderate narrowing of the spinal canal. \\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  C2-3: Anterior dural/epidural enhancing tissue fills and expands the left neural foramen and moderately narrows the spinal canal.\\n  C3-4: Anterior dural/epidural enhancing soft tissue moderately narrows the canal to approximately 7 mm, unchanged. Enhancing soft tissue fills and expands the left neural foramen, similar to the prior examination.\\n  C4-5: Dural/epidural soft tissue most prominent in the left of midline at this level moderately narrows the spinal canal and expands the left neural foramen.\\n  C5-6: Dural/epidural soft tissue in the left lateral spinal canal this level mildly narrows the spinal canal and focally extends into left neural foramen.\\n  C6-7: Mild dural thickening/epidural soft tissue in the left lateral spinal canal, focally extending into the left neural foramen.\\n  C7-T1: No significant osteophytic ridging or canal stenosis. No significant foraminal stenosis.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. No significant change in enhancing dural/epidural soft tissue thickening in the leftward cervical canal extending from C2 to C7. Again, this presumably represents residual meningioma given the patient history, potentially with a component of fibrosis. Similar appearance of involvement of multiple left-sided neural foramen, myelomalacia, and moderate central canal stenosis.\\n2. Chronic marrow changes extending from C2 to C5. Suspicious for intraosseous involvement of meningioma.\\n3. Progressive decrease in size of postsurgical fluid collection within the laminectomy bed.\\n4.

C6 vertebral body is rotated with complete loss of vertebral body height anteriorly. C7 vertebral body height loss of approximately 60% both anteriorly and posteriorly. There appears to be at least partial bony fusion at this level, better appreciated on prior CT. Mild vertebral body edema, less than expected for acute fracture.\\n\\nThe posterior aspect of the C6 vertebral endplate is displaced posteriorly up to 5 mm, contributing to mild to moderate central canal stenosis with AP canal dimension of approximately 8 mm but with focal indentation of the ventral cord due to kyphotic angulation of the canal. No cord signal abnormality.\\n\\nThe C6 facets are rotated anteriorly and anteriorly subluxed, presumably chronic given the appearance of partial osseous fusion at C6-C7. There are associated small bilateral facet effusions. Widening of the interspinous interval at this level is also likely chronic.\\n\\nSTIR hyperintensity compatible with marrow edema is throughout the C6 spinous process, C7-T1 left facet joint, and posterior/right lateral aspect of the T1 superior endplate. There is also soft tissue edema at this level, most prominent in the interspinous space but extending into the posterior paraspinal musculature. On prior CT, there is appearance of chronic periostitis along the inferior margin of the C6 spinous process.\\n\\nNo neural foraminal stenosis at this level. The anterior longitudinal ligament is is buckled anteriorly at the levels of C6-C7. The posterior longitudinal ligament appears grossly intact. The ligamentum flavum appears diffusely thinned without frank interruption. Prevertebral edema is minimal at this level.\\n\\nOtherwise, only minimal disc desiccation at C5-C6. Remaining intervertebral disc spaces are well-maintained. Prominent adenoidal and tonsillar pillar lymphoid tissue.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. Chronic appearing deformity of C6-C7 with significant loss of vertebral body height, chronic and now fixed subluxation, and kyphotic deformity favored to represent sequela of prior osteomyelitis/discitis or remote trauma. Correlation with prior imaging, if available, would be most helpful to assess the stability of this deformity.\\n2. Persistent mild soft tissue edema most evident in the interspinous interval at C6-C7 and persistent marrow edema most prominent surrounding the right-sided C7-T1 facet and throughout the C6 spinous process. On CT, there is appearance of chronic periostitis along the C6 inferior spinous process likely indicating chronic interspinous ligament injury. These findings may all be secondary to accelerated degenerative change in the setting of a chronic deformity, however persistent mild inflammatory changes of other etiology are not entirely excluded. Alternatively, an acute injury superimposed upon the chronic trauma at this level could also produce this persistent/recurrent edema. Surveillance is suggested to help exclude the possibility of otherwise occult fracture.\\n3. Moderate spinal stenosis at C6-C7 secondary to this deformity, with focal indentation of the ventral cord due to kyphotic deformity.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nPLAT-50-35\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             02/24/2021 09:36\\nResident: Upton MD RES, Hunter B\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 2/23/2021 1:17 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHistory: Cerebral cyst. Acute inflammation of orbit. Benign neoplasm of cerebral meninges. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain without and with 10 cc Gadavist IV contrast. COMPARISON: CT head February 11, 2021. FINDINGS: The diffusion weighted sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The brain parenchyma is essentially normal in appearance, without mass effect, parenchymal edema, hydrocephalus, or extra-axial collection. There is a mild cerebellar tonsillar ectopia of approximately 2 mm. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Evaluation of the orbits is limited on this MRI of the brain, however the globes appear grossly symmetric. The basilar flow-voids are intact. Following the administration of contrast, no abnormal parenchymal enhancement is observed. The densely calcified structure contiguous with the dural surface overlying the posterior right frontal lobe does not demonstrate enhancement on the current study. Although meningioma remains possible, the complete absence of enhancement suggests this may represent dural calcification/ossification.\\r\\n\""]}

Imaging performed before and after the intravenous administration of 18 cc ProHance IV contrast.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nOsseous structures: Straightening of the lumbar spine with loss of normal lordosis. Multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis.  Multilevel reactive marrow signal changes without findings to indicate acute injury nor significant pathology. This includes type I reactive endplate changes on the left at L5-S1\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury.  \\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at mid L2. The cauda equina is distributed as expected. There is no evidence of abnormal intracranial enhancement.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  L1-2: No significant disc bulge, canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L2-3: Asymmetric rightward disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac without significant canal or neural foraminal stenosis.\\n  L3-4: Mild disc bulge without significant canal stenosis. A tiny superimposed right subarticular disc protrusion abuts the transiting right L4 nerve root. Degenerative facets result in up to mild right greater than left foraminal stenosis.\\n  L4-5: Asymmetric leftward disc bulge with superimposed small/shallow left subarticular extrusion indents and flattens the thecal sac without significant canal stenosis. There is mild narrowing of the left lateral recess with mass effect on the transiting left L5 nerve root. Along with degenerative facets this results in mild/moderate left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis.\\n  L5-S1: Patient is status post left L5-S1 laminotomy and microdiscectomy. There is a residual/recurrent left central disc extrusion which indents the thecal sac and mildly narrows the canal. Healing granulation tissue or scar extends into the left lateral recess and encases the left S1 nerve roots. The left S1 nerve roots are somewhat displaced peripherally within the nerve root sleeve and there is a nonenhancing central filling defect which may represent a CSF flow void. Mild right neural and moderate left foraminal stenosis.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.  Interval laminotomy and microdiscectomy with diminished mass effect on the left S1 nerve.

Moderate to severe L5-S1 left-sided foraminal stenosis from the disc bulge. Left renal abnormality, could be a chronic subcapsular fluid collection. Correlate with history as to prior evaluation of this area. The plain film exam shows some curvilinear calcifications which would suggest this could be a chronic subcapsular hematoma. If clinically necessary to further evaluate suggest CT renal protocol. Signer Name: Douglas Kaffenberger, MD Signed: 2/22/2021 5:13 PM EST Workstation Name: B7FK243\\r\\nExam:MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY: Low back pain, > 6 wks LUMBAR BACK PAIN COMPARISON:Plain film exam from 2/4/2021. Views: Routine multiecho and multiplanar images. FINDINGS: Alignment and vertebral body heights are normal. Loss of disc space height which is moderate at L2-3, mild at L4-5 and severe at L5-S1. Type II degenerative subchondral signal changes anteriorly at L2-3. The remainder of the osseous marrow elements are of normal signal. L1-2: Normal. L2-3: Mild bulge without central stenosis. Posterior elements and foraminal areas are normal. L3-4: Normal. L4-5: Mild bulge and mild facet hypertrophy without central stenosis. Foraminal nerves are normal. L5-S1: Mild bulge although somewhat greater along the left side encroaching upon the left foramina which is moderate to severely narrowed with the bulging disc possibly causing some deformity of the inferior margin of the exiting left L5 foraminal nerve. Right foramina and nerve appear normal. Posterior elements are normal and there is no central canal stenosis at this level. Visualized portions of the conus and cauda equina nerves are normal. There is a crescent-shaped focus of fluid signal along the mid and caudal aspect of the left kidney. This appears to be extrinsic, although the shape and appearance could represent a subcapsular fluid collection. This area is of intermediate T1 and increased T2 signal with a thick rim of low T2 signal which could be from hemosiderin or calcification.\\r\\n\""]}

Postsurgical change of right parotidectomy with persistent enhancement and soft tissue edema throughout the surgical bed and adjacent masticator and parapharyngeal spaces. Overall, this is similar to slightly increased in extent since the previous exam and again may represent progressive infiltrative neoplasm and/or post radiation change. This is best seen along the posterior margin of the right mandibular condyle within the temporal mandibular joint, potentially inflammatory/degenerative or neoplastic but difficult to characterize. The subtle differences could be attributable to differences in technique from the prior exam. No significant change in abnormal bulky enhancement along the mandibular division of cranial nerve V, indicating perineural tumor spread. Nonspecific mastoid segment 7th nerve enhancement remains unchanged. Of note, some of the difficulty in 90 tail comparison is related to differences in technique and scanner on each study. For future exams, please request a 3 Tesla scanner with small field-of-view confined to the face only. This should allow for greater reproducibility and finer gradation of differences between studies.\\n\\n2.

No significant central canal stenosis is present at any thoracic level. Small Schmorl`s nodes are present in the endplates at T7-T8 and T8-T9. No significant neural foraminal narrowing is present at any thoracic level.

FINDINGS: As the interval myelogram in 2018 suggests, there has been progression of degenerative disc disease since the prior MRI in 2016. Based on the interval myelogram, which also includes radiographic views of the thoracic spine, there are diminutive 12th ribs. Levels have been numbered accordingly. The L5 vertebral segment is partially sacralized, left greater than right. The conus medullaris is positioned normally at the T12 level and remains otherwise unremarkable. Vertebral body heights and alignment are otherwise maintained. Desiccation of the L3-L4 and L4-L5 intervertebral discs again appreciated. Loss of disc space height is mild at the L3-L4 level and mild to moderate at the L4-L5 disc space. Disc space signals and heights are otherwise well-maintained. T10-T11: Mild hypertrophic facet joint degenerative change bilaterally. No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. T11-T12: Unremarkable. T12-L1: Equivocal mild circumferential disc bulge is unchanged. No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. L1-L2: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. L2-L3: Equivocal mild circumferential disc bulge. No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. Beginning at the mid L3 level, epidural lipomatosis ventrally is noted. This does contribute to mild central canal narrowing. At the L3-L4 disc space, a mild circumferential disc bulge is noted. Mild left greater than right degenerative facet joint hypertrophy is appreciated. Mild central canal stenosis is appreciated. Disc osteophyte complex at the uncovertebral joint contributes to moderate to severe foraminal stenosis on the right effacement and superior displacement of the foraminal nerve root sleeve on the right is noted. No evidence of foraminal L3 nerve root compromise on the left. L4-L5: Epidural lipomatosis within the ventral aspect of the central canal lower half of the L4 vertebra is also noted extending up to the circumferential disc bulge and central disc extrusion, which also extends approximately 5 mm posterior to the vertebral margin and approximately 3 to 4 mm above the disc space. A spondylitic ridge across the inferior L4 endplate is noted at the upper extent of the disc extrusion. Moderate degenerative facet joint hypertrophy left greater than right and mild hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum is also noted. Central canal stenosis is mild and increased from the interval myelogram, as well.. Mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenoses with disc osteophyte complexes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally also noted that there is no evidence of L4 nerve root compromise. L5-S1: Central canal and neural foramen are widely patent despite the mild bilateral facet joint degenerative change. Sacrum and SI joints are otherwise unremarkable. The paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.. IMPRESSION: Transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction. This appears to be a sacralized L5 vertebral segment with diminutive bilateral 12th ribs, based upon numbering from prior thoracic spine radiographic myelogram. Levels have been numbered accordingly. Degenerative changes at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level, primarily, are again noted. These have progressed since the prior MRI in 2016 with MRI findings worrisome for foraminal compromise of the right L3 nerve root sleeve. There is no further central canal compromise at the L5-S1 level but progression of central canal narrowing at the L4-L5 level, as well. There is also an outside reference MRI exam from 8/31/2018. The disc extrusion at that time was primarily inferior to the disc space. Given the other fatty signal changes within the epidural space at the L3 and L4 levels, this patient may have had prior partial discectomy/microdiscectomy. Please correlate clinically.

C2-3: Mild increased uncovertebral ridging in the right lateral region is noted slightly effacing the anterior thecal sac without significant central canal or foraminal stenosis C3-4: Mild increased loss of disc space height with mild vertebral ridging which effaces the anterior thecal sac and along with mild facet arthropathy results in minimal left greater than right foraminal narrowing. Central canal is slightly effaced with AP canal diameter of 9 mm, stable from prior C4-5: Mild increased loss of disc space height. Since the prior exam, there is worsening uncovertebral ridging particularly on the right. There is a small right lateral disc protrusion and a 4 to 5 mm disc protrusion on the left. These findings efface the anterior thecal sac compressing the cord with AP canal diameter of 6 mm compared to 8 mm previously.

Additionally, there is osseous fusion of the vertebral bodies at the operative levels.\\n\\nPreviously described hairline fracture of the ossified anterior longitudinal ligament at C4-C5 is better seen on CT, manifesting only as subtle STIR signal hyperintensity by MRI.\\n\\nFracture through the ossified anterior longitudinal ligament at T1-T2 is again demonstrated. Edema tracks superiorly through the anterior portion of the vertebral body, becoming contiguous with an apparent fracture of the superior endplate of T1 which is also demonstrated on CT. This fracture intersects the C7-T1 superior endplate. Fracture may involve the right T1 pedicle on sagittal image 14 series 15.\\n\\nThere is moderate prevertebral edema and hemorrhage extending from approximately C4-C5 to the upper thoracic spine but most extensive at T1-T2. Additional edema in the interspinous ligaments at C5-C6 and C7-T1. No epidural hemorrhage. No discontinuity of the posterior longitudinal ligament is identified.\\n\\nCanal contents: Mildly increased T2 signal in the cervical cord at C4-C5 and C5-C6 is presumably artifactual given adjacent fusion hardware. Susceptibility artifact from posterior fusion hardware significantly limits evaluation of the spinal canal near the levels of fusion. There is questionable subtle thickening of the dorsal epidural space with CSF signal material, only appreciated on the sagittal midline/para midline images such as image 9 of series 3 through 6. This could represent a small posttraumatic extradural collection, but does not typical signal characteristics for hematoma. This mildly narrows the central canal.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n\\nThere is moderate narrowing of the central canal at C5-C6 secondary to fused osteophytes along the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies as well as focal cervical kyphosis. AP canal dimension is approximately 7 mm at this level, with a near effacement of the CSF space. No other area of significant canal stenosis is identified.\\n\\nMultilevel foraminal stenosis is present, difficult to assess due to the degree of susceptibility artifact but at least mild at C2-C3 and moderate at C3-C4. There is apparent extension of CSF into the right C7-T1 and T1-T2 neural foramina, indeterminate for perineural cysts or pseudomeningocele.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\nRedemonstrated fracture of an ossified anterior longitudinal ligament at T1-T2 with fracture planes extending throughout the T1 vertebral body and involving the superior endplate. Fracture may involve the right T1 pedicle.\\n\\nAdditional nondisplaced fracture of the anterior longitudinal ligament at C4-C5.\\n\\nPrevertebral hemorrhage and edema secondary to aforementioned fractures.\\n\\nInterspinous ligamentous injury at C5-C6 and C7-T1.\\n\\nCSF intensity material in the right neural foramina at C7-T1 and T1-T2 could represent incidental perineural cysts or posttraumatic sitting meningocele secondary to nerve root injury if there is an associated deficit.\\n\\nMild to moderate central canal stenosis at C5-C6 due to chronic kyphotic deformity at this level.\\n\\nSuspected thin dorsal CSF intensity epidural collection measuring most 2 mm in the mid cervical spine, raising the possibility of traumatic dural tear, however this is nonspecific. No evidence of discrete epidural hematoma.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nPLAT-50-59\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             02/20/2021 12:58\\nResident: Ingram MD RES, Wesley E\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Imaging acquired before and after the intravenous and ministration of 12 mL ProHance.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nOsseous structures: Postsurgical changes of L2-S1 and iliac fusion. Associated metallic susceptibility artifact distorts assessment of adjacent tissues. Trace L3-4 spondylolisthesis attributable to degenerative facet changes, remaining alignment relatively well preserved. Multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis.  Multilevel reactive marrow signal changes without findings to indicate acute injury nor significant pathology. There is fatty replacement of the L4 and L5 vertebra compatible with remote inflammation. There is equivocal edema or signal change surrounding the left S1 screw.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury. Expected postsurgical distortion in the dorsal soft tissues. Chronic postoperative fluid collection present in the laminectomy bed is unchanged in appearance from last year..\\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at a normal level. The cauda equina is again displayed starting at L3-4 extending distally compatible with chronic arachnoiditis, unchanged from 2018. Following the intravenous and ministration of contrast, there is some linear scarring in this region compatible with fibrosis. No evidence of nodular intrathecal enhancement.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  L1-2: No significant disc bulge, canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L2-3: Postsurgical fusion. No canal or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L3-4: Trace anterolisthesis, trace disc bulge, posterior to decompression, no canal stenosis. Degenerative facets. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  L4-5: Post surgical decompression and fusion. Postinflammatory arachnoiditis changes. No canal stenosis. Moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  L5-S1: Postsurgical changes of fusion. Empty thecal sac no canal stenosis. Hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in mild/moderate foraminal narrowing on the left, mild on the right.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.  Subtle abnormal marrow signal changes surrounding the left S1 screw may indicate hardware loosening or artifact. In the setting of concern for postoperative wound infection, early infection could have this appearance though this is very mild favoring loosening or artifact over infection.

FINDINGS: There is straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis at the L4-L5 level. Loss of disc space height is mild to moderate in severity. Desiccation of the intervertebral disc and mild to moderate circumferential disc bulge are again noted. Fatty bone marrow replacement typical of Modic type III discogenic bone marrow signal change at the L4-L5 level is again noted, similar to the prior study without evidence of edema (suppresses on the STIR weighted sequence). Central canal stenosis is mild. Mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis is again appreciated without interval evidence of L4 nerve root compromise. This does remain slightly more prominent on the left. The conus medullaris is positioned normally at the L1-L2 disc space and is otherwise unremarkable. The included distal spinal cord signal is normal. The T11-T12 and T12-L1 levels are normal. At the L1-L2 level, mild desiccation of the intervertebral disc, mild circumferential disc bulge, and mild loss of disc space height are again appreciated. This is also unchanged. Central canal stenosis is mild. Mild left greater than right foraminal narrowing is again appreciated without evidence of L1 nerve root compromise. Mild desiccation of the intervertebral disc and equivocal mild circumferential disc bulge at the L2-L3 level is again noted and also unchanged without significant central canal or foraminal compromise. The L3-L4 level shows no evidence of a disc bulge but mild bilateral degenerative facet joint hypertrophy, left greater than right. This does result in mild foraminal stenoses bilaterally. Uncovertebral joint hypertrophy on the right is mild but does contribute to slightly worse narrowing on the right, without evidence of L3 nerve root compromise. The L5-S1 level is essentially normal with perhaps very mild degenerative irregularity at the facet joints but no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. Small perineural cysts (Tarlov cysts on the right at the S2 and S3 level are subcentimeter. The included sacrum and SI joints are otherwise unremarkable. The paravertebral soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.\\r\\n\""]}

Seaton MD Signed: 2/19/2021 1:11 PM EST Workstation Name: 822FDH2\\r\\nEXAM: Multiaxial multiplanar MR of the cervical spine without and with IV contrast using 5 mL Gadavist TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was performed through the cervical spine using standard protocol. INDICATION: Neck pain, chronic COMPARISON: MRI C-spine 11/6/2017 FINDINGS: Anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 measures 3 mm. Anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 measures 4 mm. No cervical cord signal abnormality or abnormal enhancement in the cervical cord identified. There is severe intervertebral disc height loss at C4-C5 through C6-C7 with moderate height loss at C2-C3 and C3-C4. Degenerative signal changes are present in the endplates throughout the cervical spine most pronounced surrounding the C3-C4 disc space with mild associated edema. Patchy postcontrast enhancement in the C5 and C6 vertebra is most likely of degenerative etiology. Facet arthrosis also present at all levels. No significant narrowing of the craniocervical junction. C2-C3: No definite neural foraminal narrowing. Anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 in combination with facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening causes mild spinal canal narrowing. C3-C4: Anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 measuring 4 mm in combination with ligamentum flavum thickening causes moderate spinal canal narrowing to an AP diameter of 8mm at midline with partial effacement of CSF. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C4-C5: Posterior osteophytic ridging in combination with buckling/thickening of the ligamentum flavum causes severe spinal canal narrowing to an AP diameter of 6 mm at midline with complete effacement of CSF. Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C5-C6: Posterior osteophytic ridging in combination with buckling/thickening of the ligamentum flavum causes severe narrowing of the spinal canal to an AP diameter of 6 mm at midline with complete effacement of CSF. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C6-C7: Posterior osteophytic ridging causes moderate narrowing of the spinal canal to an AP diameter of 9 mm at midline with partial effacement of CSF. Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C7-T1: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.\\r\\n\""]}

Seaton MD Signed: 2/17/2021 1:22 PM EST Workstation Name: 822FDH2\\r\\nEXAM: Multiaxial multiplanar MR of the lumbar spine without contrast TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was performed through the lumbar spine using standard protocol. INDICATION: Lumbago COMPARISON: None available FINDINGS: Five nonrib bearing lumbar type vertebral bodies are present. There is 3 mm left lateral listhesis of L4 on L5. Alignment at the remaining levels is maintained. There are moderate degenerative signal changes in the endplates surrounding the L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc space. Associated mild edema in the endplates surrounding the L4-L5 disc space. Vertebral bodies demonstrate normal heights with no evidence of fracture. The conus terminates at L1 and demonstrates normal signal intensity. Included paravertebral soft tissues demonstrate small bilateral renal cysts. T12-L1: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L1-L2: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L2-L3: There is intervertebral disc height loss with disc desiccation and a small broad-based posterior disc bulge causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal. Disc material causes mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. L3-L4: There is intervertebral disc height loss with disc desiccation and broad-based posterior disc bulge. Disc bulging combination with facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening causes moderate narrowing of the spinal canal to an AP diameter of 8mm at midline. Disc material causes mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. L4-L5: There is moderate-severe disc height loss with small right paracentral disc extrusion and inferior migration of disc material approximately 9 mm below the disc space. Disc material in combination with posterior osteophytic ridging, facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening crowds the traversing nerve roots in the right lateral recess. There is mild left and mild-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. L5-S1: There is moderate disc height loss with broad-based posterior disc bulge closely approximating but not definitively displacing the bilateral traversing S1 nerve roots. Disc material in combination with facet hypertrophy causes moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, possibly contacting the bilateral exiting L5 nerve roots. The remaining visualized sacral nerve roots are grossly unremarkable.\\r\\n\""]}

There is a large bifrontal infiltrative mass which crosses the anterior corpus callosum, extends dorsally into the posterior right frontal lobe and superior right temporal lobe. Regions of enhancement are complex with parenchymal ring enhancement, incomplete rings of enhancement, and superimposed leptomeningeal and subependymal enhancement. Findings discussed with Dr. Roberts who reported the patient had a relatively rapid personality change with memory loss and does not appear septic. Findings most compatible with a GBM, high-grade or dedifferentiated extensive primary CNS neoplasm. Signer Name: Richard Ian Gray Signed: 2/17/2021 2:10 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DX3SZ2\\r\\nEXAM: MRI BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST CLINICAL: Mental status change, unknown cause R27 COMPARISON: CT head 3/17/2013 TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was performed through the brain without and with intravenous contrast utilizing standard protocol. INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: 10 mL Gadavist FINDINGS: Quality: Diagnostic quality exam though some images are motion degraded INTRACRANIAL: Hemorrhage: No findings to indicate acute intracranial hemorrhage. Acute infarct: No findings to indicate acute infarct. Diminished diffusivity is present within regions and along the posterior edge of the infiltrative mass. No diffusion restriction within the necrotic component. Brain parenchyma: There is an infiltrative abnormal signal involving bilateral frontal lobes and extending into the posterior right frontal lobe and temporal lobe. Within this lesion, there is a ring-enhancing lesion along the medial right frontal lobe but regions of leptomeningeal and subependymal enhancement in conjunction with irregular heterogeneous incomplete rinds of parenchymal enhancement. Ring-enhancing lesions are present within the posterior right margin of the infiltrative tumor. Enhancing tumor extends into the right cerebral peduncle. CSF spaces: Mass effect subtotally effaces the frontal horns and deforms the lateral ventricular bodies. No evidence of obstruction. Midline anatomy: Infiltrative tumor crosses midline. Mass effect contributes to approximately 15 mm of right-to-left midline shift. Flow-voids: Difficult to characterize secondary to motion however are likely intact. Other: Irregular morphology superior to the external auditory canal is likely a small exostosis. CRANIAL/EXTRACRANIAL: Marrow: No clear evidence for pathologic marrow signal. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells: Minimal right mastoid fluid. Visualized orbits: Unremarkable appearance on this limited assessment of the orbits. Other: Noncontributory.\\r\\n\""]}

COMPARISON: 2/17/2021, 1/3/2020, 8/5/2019 CT head exams Note: Motion artifact degrades the study. FINDINGS: Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates estimated 5-6 mm round well-circumscribed signal void and paramagnetic phenomenon within the right pons. Postcontrast sequence demonstrates punctate focus of internal enhancement. A cavernous angioma is favored. No vasogenic edema or mass effect. Similar well-circumscribed round signal abnormality is identified in the deep cortical white matter left frontoparietal hemisphere measuring 6 to 7 mm. Both lesions are unchanged compared with previous CTs dating back to 8/5/2019. No cortical effacement or mass effect. Ventricular system is normal. No evidence of extra-axial bleed. Normal flow void within the major cerebral vessels. Normal enhancement of the dural sinuses. Nonspecific, homogeneous enhancement of the pituitary stalk. Etiologies include, but are not limited to, cellular infiltrate in the setting of neurosarcoidosis or histiocytosis, infection, less likely, neoplasm. Pituitary gland is grossly normal but not optimally visualized.\\r\\n\""]}

A chronic regional infarct involves the inferior left parietal lobe with associated encephalomalacia and gliosis. Chronic infarcts are also present in the left basal ganglia. T2/FLAIR hyperintensities throughout the periventricular and to a lesser extent subcortical white matter are nonspecific but compatible with moderate microangiopathic changes, Fazekas 2. There is hemosiderin deposition associated with the left basal ganglia infarct but no pathologic hemosiderin deposition elsewhere in the brain. Global parenchymal atrophy is moderate. Medial temporal atrophy is also moderate but somewhat more advanced than the degree of generalized atrophy, MTA 3 bilaterally. There is no hydrocephalus or extra axial collection. Evidence of bilateral ocular lens replacement. Paranasal sinuses are essentially clear. No pathologic enhancement is identified on postcontrast sequences.\\r\\n\""]}

For example, a right hepatic metastasis on series 22, image 32 measures 2.1 x 3.3 cm compared with 4 x 4 cm in December 2020. However, there are multiple new hepatic metastases such as seen in the posteromedial right hepatic lobe on series 22, image 51.\\nBile Ducts: No significant abnormality.

FINDINGS: Glenohumeral joint: Sizable joint effusion with no obvious loose bodies or synovitis. Mild surrounding soft tissue edema immediately and inferiorly. Postcontrast images show smooth uniform synovial enhancement. Normal variant absence of the anterior superior labrum. Normal variant appearing sublabral recess of the superior labrum. No threshold labral tears. No other evidence for arthritis. Rotator cuff: Tendinosis of the superior subscapularis tendon. No rotator cuff tears. No gross rotator muscle atrophy. No evidence for impingement on the supraspinatus outlet. Long biceps tendon: The biceps anchor and proximal long biceps tendon is normal. However the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove and distal is attenuated and mildly hyperintense and there is surrounding enhancing soft tissue edema nearby. This is suggestive of distal partial tear. Acromioclavicular joint: Mild degenerative change. Subacromial subdeltoid bursa: Normal, no bursitis. Bones: Negative.

Post surgical changes of L5-S1 with minimal progression of mild spondylosis at L4-5, now with a small central protrusion but no significant canal stenosis. Otherwise, findings similar in appearance the prior study.\\n2.  Postprocedural changes at L2-3 with small residual low signal focus within the thecal sac. This may represent postprocedural calcification. This was likely present on the prior exam and better seen on today`s study secondary to improvements in technique though is too small to characterize. Correlation with history of intervention at this level recommended. This is unlikely to be clinically significant however if the patient develops new or worsening symptoms, attention on follow-up may be helpful.\\n\\nPLAT-BUILD-BC1\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: GRAY MD, RICHARD I                          02/15/2021 15:41\\n\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Spinal canal narrowing is severe at C4-C5 with associated short segment cervical cord myelomalacia. Moderate-severe spinal canal narrowing at C5-C6. Severe neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally at C4-C5 and on the right at C5-C6. Signer Name: Brady C. Seaton MD Signed: 2/17/2021 9:34 AM EST Workstation Name: 822FDH2\\r\\nEXAM: Multiaxial multiplanar MR of the cervical spine without contrast TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was performed through the cervical spine using standard protocol. INDICATION: Neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, cervical degenerative disc disease pain radiating to right shoulder COMPARISON: Correlation with cervical spine radiographs 10/9/2021 FINDINGS: Alignment of the cervical spine is maintained. There is reversal of expected cervical lordosis centered at C4-C5. Cervical vertebrae demonstrate normal heights and signal intensity. No evidence of fracture. There is short segment increased T2 signal in the cervical cord at the level of C4-C5 compatible with myelomalacia.. Included paravertebral soft tissues appear normal. No significant narrowing of the craniocervical junction. C2-C3: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. C3-C4: Trace broad-based posterior disc bulge causes mild narrowing of the spinal canal to an AP diameter of 8mm at midline. Moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C4-C5: Moderate disc height loss. Broad-based posterior disc bulging combination with posterior osteophytic ridging causes severe spinal canal narrowing to an AP diameter of 6 mm with complete effacement of CSF. Associated short segment subtle increased T2 signal in the cervical cord is compatible with myelomalacia. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C5-C6: Moderate disc height loss. Broad-based posterior disc bulging combination with posterior osteophytic ridging most prominent right of midline causes moderate narrowing of the spinal canal to an AP diameter of 7 mm at midline with partial effacement of CSF. Severe right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. C6-C7: Moderate disc height loss. Broad-based posterior disc bulging combination with posterior osteophytic ridging most prominent right of midline causes mild narrowing of the spinal canal to an AP diameter of 9 mm at midline with trace effacement of ventral CSF space. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C7-T1: Trace disc bulge without significant spinal canal narrowing. No neural foraminal narrowing.\\r\\n\""]}

Patient with additional benign bilateral breast biopsies following initial staging breast MR.\\n\\nCOMPARISON: Breast MRI 8/25/2020.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Bilateral breast MR 3T imaging was performed with a dedicated 16 channel Sentinel breast coil.  Patient was  placed prone with the breast  immobilized with light compression. Following localization sequence used: T2 SPAIR axial fat-suppressed, T1 Axial non fat suppressed 3-D, T1 3-D fat-suppressed precontrast followed by serial T1 axial 3-D fat-suppressed post-dynamic imaging. Contrast delay of 20 seconds. Dynamic sequences were post processed to optimize radiologist interpretation by generating 3D reconstructions, subtraction images and multiplanar reformats from the dynamic contrast data at a separate DynaCad workstation.

Improved/resolved overlying skin thickening with edema and patchy enhancement. Minimal foci of residual enhancement in the upper central right breast (around axial image 102 for example).\\n\\nSignificantly decreased right axillary lymphadenopathy, now with morphologically normal-appearing lymph nodes.\\n\\nNo residual abnormal enhancement at site of additional benign biopsy sites in the upper outer quadrant right breast and upper inner quadrant left breast.\\n\\nNo new or suspicious enhancement otherwise identified.\\n\\nStable postsurgical changes related to augmentation mammoplasty with subpectoral saline implants.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 6, known biopsy-proven malignancy.\\nSignificantly decreased enhancement (essentially resolved by MR) at site of known biopsy-proven malignancy in the medial/upper inner quadrant right breast with resolved axillary lymphadenopathy and overlying skin changes.

Thick slab, heavily T2-weighted MRCP images were also acquired.\\n\\nFINDINGS:   \\n\\nLiver: Normal in size and contour. No evidence for steatosis. Within the peripheral left hepatic lobe, there is a 10 mm moderately T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense lesion (series 12, image 10 and series 11, image 19). Artifact from air within the adjacent gastric lumen limits evaluation, however there is no definite postcontrast enhancement. Based on T2 alone, subjectively, lesion is probably a hemangioma, although lack of enhancement could suggest this is an atypical hemangioma or a mildly complicated cyst. This lesion corresponds to lesion seen on prior CT. No other focal hepatic lesions. Benign appearing perfusional arterial hyperenhancement in the left hepatic lobe posteriorly. Hepatic and portal veins are unremarkable.\\n\\nBiliary Tree: Prior cholecystectomy. No intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. There is normal tapering of the common duct to the ampulla.\\n\\nSpleen: Normal size and signal. 6 mm splenic cyst.\\n\\nPancreas: No significant fatty atrophy. Normal parenchymal T1 hyperintensity with homogenous enhancement. No mass. Pancreatic duct is nondilated. No peripancreatic inflammatory change.\\n\\nAdrenals: Unremarkable signal and morphology.\\n\\nKidneys: 2 mm right renal cyst. No worrisome enhancement. No hydronephrosis or proximal hydroureter.\\n\\nOther:\\nVasculature is unremarkable.\\nNo free intraperitoneal fluid or loculated fluid collections.\\nNo worrisome adenopathy.\\n\\nVisualized bowel is nondilated.\\n\\nPartially visualized right upper quadrant breast cancer. No other abnormality of the included body wall.\\nNo worrisome osseous abnormality.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  \\nA 1 cm left hepatic lobe lesion remains indeterminate, but there is little, if any significant suspicion that this is a metastasis. Primary considerations include a simple or mildly complicated cyst versus an atypical hemangioma. Although lesion may be difficult to assess by ultrasound due to a small sliver of lung parenchyma anterior to it on prior CT, hepatic ultrasound could be considered to better assess or follow the lesion. Alternatively, hepatic protocol MRI in 3 months would likely be reassuring.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nPLATBUILD1011\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: DEWITT MD, CHERYL D                         02/16/2021 08:49\\nResident: Thakur MD RES, Sneha\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Biopsy of left axillary lymph node also showed nodal involvement.\\n\\nCOMPARISON: Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound 2/9/2021.\\n\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Bilateral breast MR 3T imaging was performed with a dedicated 8 channel Dynacad breast coil.  Patient was  placed prone with the breast  immobilized with light compression. Following localization sequence used: T2 tirm axial fat-suppressed, T1 Axial non fat suppressed 3-D, T1 3-D fat-suppressed precontrast followed by serial T1 axial 3-D fat-suppressed post-dynamic imaging. Contrast delay of 20 seconds. Dynamic sequences were post processed to optimize radiologist interpretation by generating 3D reconstructions, subtraction images and multiplanar reformats from the dynamic contrast data at a separate Dynacad workstation. Patient received 0.1Mm/kg Multihance IV 15 mL.\\n\\nMR FINDINGS:\\n\\nAmount of fibroglandular tissue: Heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue\\n\\nBackground parenchymal enhancement: Mild\\n\\nRIGHT BREAST:  Scattered small enhancing foci. There are couple well-circumscribed cysts in the upper outer quadrant measuring up to 1.6 cm maximally, one of which is proteinaceous. No suspicious enhancing masses.\\n\\nLEFT BREAST:  Spanning the 9:00 through the 12:00 to the 3:00 position, there is a heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 6 cm transverse x 4.9 cm anterior posterior by 4 cm craniocaudal, demonstrating associated intrinsic low T1 and intermediate T2 signal.  A well-hydrated hydro-mark is in place. This is biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma. \\nImmediately adjacent to this at the 3-4:00 position, there is an irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 2.2 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm, also with associated low T1 and intermediate T2 signal. Well-hydrated hydro-mark is in place. This is also biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma. \\nIn the immediate subareolar region, approximately 1 to 2 mm from the nipple itself, there is a 0.9 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm homogenously enhancing mass, highly suspicious for additional multicentric disease.\\nBesides the immediately subareolar mass, there is no tumor encroaching upon either the skin surface or chest wall.\\nA couple of benign left breast cysts are also noted.\\n \\n\\nNIPPLE/AREOLAR COMPLEX:  LEFT breast subareolar mass as described above. The nipple-areolar complexes enhance symmetrically.\\n\\nAXILLA:  Several enlarged and morphologically abnormal left axillary level 1 lymph nodes, including a 1.4 cm short axis node, biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma, with hydrated hydro-mark in place. There are also couple morphologically abnormal level 2 lymph nodes, with a tiny Rotter`s node present, but non specific.\\n\\nINTERNAL MAMMARY NODES:  There are two frankly abnormal left internal mammary chain lymph nodes, the largest measuring up to 0.6 cm short axis.

Signer Name: Brady C. Seaton MD Signed: 2/15/2021 3:33 PM EST Workstation Name: 822FDH2\\r\\nEXAM: Multiaxial multiplanar MR of the lumbar spine without contrast TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was performed through the lumbar spine using standard protocol. INDICATION: Low back pain, > 6 wks COMPARISON: MRI 6/27/2018 FINDINGS: This report assumes 5 lumbar-type vertebra. Dextroscoliotic curvature is centered at L2-L3. Alignment of the lumbar spine is maintained. Severe predominantly Modic type I degenerative signal changes are present in the endplates surrounding the L2-L3 disc space at and left of midline with associated disc height loss, significantly worsened since the prior exam. Mild degenerative signal changes are noted in the endplates surrounding the L1-L2 and L5-S1 disc spaces. The conus terminates at L1 and demonstrates normal signal intensity. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. T12-L1: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L1-L2: There is intervertebral disc height loss with disc desiccation. Broad-based posterior disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac without significant narrowing of the spinal canal. No neural foraminal narrowing. L2-L3: Significantly worsened near complete intervertebral disc height loss at and left of midline with Modic type I endplate signal changes. Broad-based posterior disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac causing mild spinal canal narrowing to an AP diameter of 10 mm at midline. No right neural foraminal narrowing. Disc material in combination with facet hypertrophy and posterior osteophytic ridging causes moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. L3-L4: Trace broad-based posterior disc bulge causing mild spinal canal narrowing. Disc material and facet hypertrophy cause moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. No left neural foraminal narrowing. L4-L5: Mild broad-based posterior disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac causing mild spinal canal narrowing disc material in combination with facet hypertrophy causes moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. There is a moderate left facet effusion. L5-S1: Unchanged small left foraminal disc protrusion. No spinal canal narrowing. Disc material and correlation with facet hypertrophy causes moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing. The visualized sacral nerve roots are grossly unremarkable.\\r\\n\""]}

There is abnormal signal within the C5-C6 vertebral bodies with abnormal fluid collection in the anterior paracervical soft tissues extending from approximately C4-T1. The largest dimension measures up to approximately 9 mm at the level of C7.\\n\\nThere is posterior disc protrusion at C5-C6 which slightly effaces the anterior surface of the cord but does not contribute to significant central canal stenosis. Immediately above C5-C6 intervertebral disc space posteriorly there is a posterior protrusion that demonstrates fluid signal suggesting a small epidural abscess measuring up to 3 mm not contributing to significant central canal stenosis.

CT thoracic spine January 16, 2021. MRI lumbar spine November 28, 2020.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nThoracic spine: Postsurgical changes of posterior fusion extending from T8 to L2. Dense susceptibility artifact related to fusion hardware completely obscures the spine and spinal canal at the operative levels. Anterior wedging of T7 is similar to prior MRI, with persistent edema in the T7 vertebral body. Thickening of the epidural fat at the T7 level is similar to the prior examination, again mildly narrowing the spinal canal. The spinal canal is not diagnostically evaluated at the levels of fusion. Kyphotic deformity centered about T11 is grossly similar to the prior examination.\\n\\nAbove the operative levels, mild degenerative changes are similar to the prior examination. A small central protrusion at T4-T5 does not significantly narrow the central canal. No pathologic cord signal is identified above the operative levels.\\n\\nScout images demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine which are grossly unchanged from prior imaging.\\n\\nLumbar spine: Vertebral body height and alignment is unchanged from prior imaging. The spinal canal and spine above the L2 mid body level is not diagnostically evaluated due to extensive susceptibility artifact from fusion hardware. No marrow edema is identified in the visible lumbar spine. No pathologic enhancement is identified in the visible lumbar spine.\\n\\nL2-L3: No significant spinal or foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nL3-L4: Minimal disc bulging without significant spinal or foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nL4-L5: Small broad-based disc bulge. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nL5-S1: Small broad-based disc bulge with central protrusion without significant central canal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet arthropathy without significant neural foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. As on prior MRI studies, the operative levels of T8-L2 are not diagnostically evaluated due to extensive magnetic susceptibility artifact from spinal hardware. Given the mutations of MR in this patient, consider surveillance with CT to monitor for progressive disease.\\n2. Persistent edema at T7 with irregularity of the inferior endplate suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis/discitis. Persistent thickening of the epidural fat at this level suggesting a component of residual epidural edema and/or inflammation.\\n3.

Technique: MR brain without and with 7.5 cc Gadavist IV contrast. COMPARISON: MRI brain October 5, 2018. FINDINGS: Multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions are again demonstrated in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. A few lesions are diminished in volume to the prior examination, notably a left frontal lesion image 9 series 401 and a left parietal periventricular lesion image 11. A left inferior parietal lesion also on image 11 is increased from the prior examination. Other apparently new lesions are in the middle cerebellar peduncles and adjacent pons bilaterally, in the posterior left temporal lobe, and in the left frontal subcortical white matter. No diffusion restriction or pathologic enhancement is identified to suggest active demyelination. No pathologic hemosiderin deposition is on the GRE sequence. There is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or extra-axial collection. The expected physiologic flow voids are intact.\\r\\n\""]}

There is a small amount of gyriform T1 hyperintensity and susceptibility artifact in the region of chronic left parietal and temporal infarcts compatible with cortical laminar necrosis and hemosiderin staining.\\nMass effect: Approximately 7 mm focal right to left midline shift of the frontal lobe is unchanged from recent CT.\\nBrain parenchyma: No evidence of acute infarct. There is restricted diffusion associated with the above-described blood products. There are multifocal areas of chronic infarct involving the left temporal, posterior frontal, and parietal lobes, left basal ganglia, left insular and subinsular regions, and a small lacunar infarct in the left pons.  Moderate patchy bilateral areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity are most likely attributable to chronic microvascular ischemic changes and gliosis, however there is prominent FLAIR hyperintensity within the bilateral dorsal and medial thalami and right caudate nucleus which is atypical. No abnormal restricted diffusion or enhancement in these areas. There is mild diffuse smooth dural thickening and hyperenhancement which is likely reactive and not unexpected in the setting of resolving intracranial hemorrhage.\\nVentricles: Dilated ventricles compatible with underlying volume loss.\\nVasculature: Major arterial flow voids are maintained.\\nOther: None.\\n\\n\\nCRANIAL/EXTRACRANIAL:\\nBones: No suspicious marrow signal abnormality.\\nParanasal sinuses and mastoid air cells: There is mild scattered sinus mucosal thickening. \\nOrbits: Changes of lens replacement without other gross orbital abnormality.\\nOther: No acute soft tissue finding. \\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\nRelatively symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the bilateral dorsal and medial thalami, atypical for chronic ischemic changes and raising possibility of a superimposed metabolic or infectious process, nonspecific with wide differential including etiologies such as Wernicke encephalopathy, atypical PRES, and viral encephalitis. Hyperintensity in the right caudate head is likely related to the same process (the left caudate head has previously infarcted and cannot be assessed).\\n\\nMultiple areas of chronic infarct and presumed microvascular ischemic changes as described.\\n\\nSlowly resolving large right frontal parenchymal hematoma. No evidence of an underlying mass or vascular malformation on this exam.

No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Focal subcortical T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe is nonspecific but unchanged from the prior examination of 2010 and therefore likely benign. This could represent a manifestation of migraine. Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 2/11/2021 1:02 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHISTORY: Headache, chronic, no new features.. Technique: MRI of the brain without contrast. COMPARISON: MRI brain April 14, 2010.. FINDINGS: The diffusion sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. A few subtle T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter are nonspecific but compatible with minimal microangiopathic changes. A subcortical T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe on images 15 and 14 of series 601 is nonspecific but unchanged from the prior study of 2010 and the vessels likely incidental. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear.\\r\\n\""]}

Mild flattening/loss of sphericity of the superior femoral head without obvious macro fracture. These findings suggest AVN.  Degenerative changes with osteophytes, joint effusion, multifocal regional synovitis. Mild surrounding soft tissue edema. Labral degeneration.

These could represent manifestations of abnormally advanced for age microangiopathic change, however other etiologies such as migraine or demyelinating disease could also produce these findings. 3. Study is somewhat limited by magnetic susceptibility artifact of uncertain origin arising from the vicinity of the right ear and obscuring portions of the adjacent brain.

FINDINGS: Magnetic susceptibility artifact of uncertain etiology obscures portions of the right cerebral hemisphere on the GRE and diffusion-weighted sequence. The diffusion sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. A a few T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions are in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. These are nonspecific. These could manifestations of abnormally advanced for age microangiopathic change. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. There is no abnormal parenchymal enhancement following the administration of IV contrast. Small right maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst.

COMPARISON: No previous study is available for comparison. FINDINGS: The diffusion sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. Increased signal in the medial right temporal lobe on DWI appears to represent artifact. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. T2/FLAIR hyperintensities scattered throughout the periventricular and subcortical white matter are nonspecific but compatible with mild microangiopathic changes. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. There is no abnormal parenchymal enhancement following the administration of IV contrast.

Adjacent paravertebral soft tissues in the neck appear grossly unremarkable.\\n\\nCraniocervical junction is patent.\\n\\nC2-C3 is well maintained.\\n\\nC3-C4 shows a mild disc bulge but no significant central stenosis.

This facet arthropathy and some rightward uncovertebral spurring does result in some moderate right-sided neural foraminal stenosis.

Area of diffusion restriction which appears to involve the right anterior pons and demonstrates associated abnormal enhancement. While findings could represent acute infarction cannot exclude other etiologies such as lymphoma, sarcoidosis or metastasis. Recommend clinical correlation and further evaluation. Of note, imaging was performed on a 1.0T open MRI and patient could benefit from repeat imaging on a stronger magnet for improved imaging/evaluation. Few scattered T2/flair white matter hyperintensities suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic changes. Signer Name: Hunter Pearson Signed: 2/4/2021 7:35 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DK2SZ2\\r\\nEXAM: Multisequence multiplanar MR of the brain without and with 7.5 mm Gadavist INDICATION: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) COMPARISON: CT head, CTA head neck to 3/20/2021 FINDINGS: Exam is degraded by motion. Very subtle area of diffusion restriction is noted along the right anterior pons. No increased susceptibility to suggest hemorrhage. Punctate foci of increased susceptibility within the basal ganglia likely represent calcifications or remote microhemorrhage. Nonspecific T2/FLAIR periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensities within both cerebral hemispheres likely reflect sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic change. No definite evidence of abnormal T1, T2 or FLAIR signal abnormality involving the right anterior pons. Midline structures are intact. The sella turcica and its contents are unremarkable. The lateral ventricles are nondilated. The basilar cisterns are patent. Major physiologic flow voids are maintained. Intravenous contrast was employed and there is an irregular area of abnormal enhancement involving the right anterior pons measuring up to 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm with a slight nodular appearance on sagittal imaging. Cataract surgery. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.\\r\\n\""]}

Cord caliber and signal are normal.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal. \\nAt T1-T2, broad-based disc bulge narrows the canal to approximately 9 mm in AP diameter. This, in conjunction with the previously demonstrated to represent disc herniation contributes to right greater than left subarticular zone narrowing and results in severe right and mild left neuroforaminal stenosis.\\n\\nAt T7-T8, small left paracentral/subarticular disc protrusion indents the ventral thecal sac without significant canal or neuroforaminal stenosis.\\nAt T8-T9, small central disc protrusion without significant canal or neural foraminal stenosis.\\nAt T10-T11, small right paracentral disc protrusion without significant central canal or neuroforaminal stenosis.\\nSmall multilevel disc protrusions elsewhere without significant canal or neuroforaminal stenosis.\\nAt T11-12, asymmetric left hypertrophic facet arthropathy results in moderate severe left and mild/moderate right foraminal narrowing.\\n\\nOther: Small left greater than right pleural effusions.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.

Smooth contour. A few scattered areas of tiny nodular arterial phase hyperenhancement in the left and right hepatic lobe such as seen on series 20, images 27, 50, 43, and 52 show no obvious signal abnormality on portal venous phase or other sequences, most compatible with tiny benign lesions such as shunts.\\nBile Ducts: Similar extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation up to 1.4 cm, likely reservoir effect status post cholecystectomy. Minimally prominent intrahepatic biliary ducts similar to prior exam as well.\\nGallbladder: Surgically absent.\\nPancreas: Multiple pancreatic lesions are redemonstrated: Unchanged 1.5 cm dominant pancreatic head lesion (series 8 image 34), 8 mm pancreatic body lesion (image 29), and adjacent pancreatic body lesion measuring 8 mm on the same image. 1.2 cm pancreatic tail lesion (image 25) is not significantly changed. Some of these again demonstrate ductal communication while others do not definitively. Please note at least the majority of these lesions have been present dating back to 7/30/2010, some of which are unchanged from that time, while most have at least minimally enlarged from that time. The dominant pancreatic head lesion measured about 0.6 cm in 2010, now 1.5 cm. No main pancreatic ductal dilatation. Redemonstrated pancreatic divisum.\\nSpleen: No splenomegaly. \\nAdrenals: 1.9 cm right adrenal fatty lesion consistent with benign myelolipoma, unchanged.\\nKidneys: Unchanged renal cysts. No hydronephrosis.\\n\\nVisualized Bowel/Peritoneum: The visualized small and large bowel show no abnormal dilatation. Colonic diverticulosis. Small hiatal hernia.\\nLymph Nodes: No lymphadenopathy.\\nAorta: No abdominal aortic aneurysm. \\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nRedemonstrated multiple pancreatic cystic lesions some demonstrating ductal communication most consistent with IPMNs. Lesions are overall generally stable from February 2020, however the majority of these have at least minimally enlarged from 2010, of uncertain clinical significance.

Found on CT from 2/8/21, Abdominal mass, intra-abdominal neoplasm suspected\\r\\n\\r\\nIMPRESSION: Mass seen arising from the pancreas which is possibly cystic. The postcontrast enhancement may suggest multiple microcysts most consistent with a benign serous cystadenoma. T1-weighted signal is elevated which could suggest mucin-containing entities such as a mucinous cystadenoma or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. No significant solid enhancing component is detected. Follow-up imaging of these lesions are generally performed at 6 months to assess for evidence of growth that may suggest an aggressive process usually characterized by greater than 1 cm growth linear or growth larger than 3 cm. However, given that the patient is acutely symptomatic, surgical consultation should be considered. Signer Name: Wyndham Owens MD Signed: 2/10/2021 10:42 AM EST Workstation Name: DH1TCP2\\r\\nHistory Abdominal mass along the pancreatic neck. Technique Multiple multisequence MRI images of the abdomen without and with IV contrast. A T2 hyperintense 10 x 9 mm focus is seen within the right lobe liver axial image 28. This appears to have a central area of enhancement which represent vessel. There is a stone seen within the gallbladder measuring 1.8 cm. Smaller stones are also suspected. There is mild gallbladder wall thickening, however, the gallbladder is nondistended. No pericholecystic fluid is seen. There is fatty infiltration the liver. A 2.9 x 2 cm T2 hyperintense T1 mildly hyperintense lesion is seen abutting or arising from the superior margin of the pancreas at the junction of the head and body.. There is peripheral enhancement and enhancing septa within this structure which gives the appearance of a multiloculated cyst. There is restricted diffusion. No adenopathy is detected. The paraspinous musculature is grossly normal. The left and right kidneys are grossly normal. The adrenal glands are normal in appearance. Osseous structures are unremarkable.\\r\\n\""]}

Views:Routine multiecho and multiplanar images. FINDINGS: Alignment is normal. Severe loss of disc space height at L4-5 L5-S1. There are superior endplate compression deformities which are mild at L1 and L2 and mild to moderate at L3 and L4 levels with associated subchondral marrow edema. Also noted are low signal fracture lines involving the posterior superior corner of L1 and L2 vertebrae and subchondral location inferiorly at L1 level, and superiorly at L3 and L4 levels. These linear fracture lines extend to the posterior cortex. There is mild posterior buckling of the posterior superior corner of L2 vertebral body with very mild anterior vertebral canal encroachment. Other locations show moderate increased T1 marrow signal likely from osteoporosis. There are other more geographic areas of low T1 signal indicating marrow replacement and this involves the S1 vertebra, and small rounded foci at L2, L4 and L5 levels and adjacent to the superior recess of the right T12-L1 foramina. This likely involves the right T12 transverse process. There is no other focal area involving the posterior medial right ilium. L1-2: No bulge, herniation or central stenosis. Posterior elements are intact. Foraminal nerves are normal. L2-3: Mild bulge and facet hypertrophy with generalized mild thecal sac attenuation. Foraminal nerves are normal. L3-4: No bulge or herniation. Posterior elements are normal. Foraminal nerves are normal. L4-5: Minimal bulge/spur greater towards left with any mild left ventral thecal sac deformity without central stenosis. Mild facet hypertrophy. Foraminal nerves are normal. L5-S1: No bulge or herniation. Descending S1 nerve roots and thecal sac and posterior elements are normal. Foraminal nerves are normal.

This is fusiform extending anterior posterior for 4.4 cm. A defect seen in the adjacent skin. Minimal reactive signal is seen in the adjacent distal fibula without evidence of osteomyelitis. The peroneal tendons abut this area without evidence of involvement. Mild increased signal seen within the Achilles tendon which could represent mild tendinosis. The flexor tendons, extensor tendons, and spring ligament appear to be intact. The fibular collateral ligaments are intact. The deltoid ligaments are intact. The tibiotalar joint space is normal in appearance. The subtalar joint appears to be normal with exception of mild effusion seen posteriorly. No erosions are detected. Osteoarthritic changes are seen at the medial cuneiform and first metatarsal joints. There is enthesophyte formation seen at the calcaneal plantar fascial origin which could be the sequela of chronic plantar fasciitis.\\r\\n\""]}

Views: Routine multiecho and multiplanar images. FINDINGS: Alignment is normal without subluxation. There is low signal from orthopedic hardware from anterior fusion surgery at C5-6. T7 level shows stable moderate to severe anterior wedge deformity. T10 level shows compression fracture at the anterior midportion with 40-50% loss of vertebral body height at the midportion with some associated marrow edema. There is no paraspinal reaction. T11 level shows mild inferior endplate compression deformity with subchondral marrow and no paraspinal reaction. T12 shows compression deformity at the anterior and especially midportion with 80% loss of vertebral body height at the midportion and some underlying mild marrow edema. There is no paraspinal reaction. There is mild focal convex curvature of the posterior superior corner of T12 only causing mild vertebral canal encroachment without cord deformity. There are no other areas of vertebral canal encroachment or mass effect upon the spinal cord. The other levels show generalized moderate increased T1 marrow signal suggesting osteoporosis. Also noted are some areas of low signal which could be from kyphoplasty procedure at T10 and T12 levels although correlate clinically. This was not evident on prior studies. Thoracic levels show no evidence of disc herniation, bulges or central canal stenosis. There is mild facet hypertrophy on the left at T11-12. Foraminal areas are patent. There is a thin vertical linear focus of fluid signal in the central portion of the spinal cord at C5-6. This is only 2 mm in diameter and approximately 10 mm in length. Paraspinal areas are unremarkable although there are are some patchy indistinct densities in the posterior lung bases bilaterally which are nonspecific.\\r\\n\""]}

Signer Name: Douglas Kaffenberger, MD Signed: 2/9/2021 2:09 PM EST Workstation Name: B7FK243\\r\\nExam:MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY: m54.5 COMPARISON:MRI lumbar spine from 12/6/2018. Views: Routine multiecho and multiplanar images. FINDINGS: There is mild increase in the degree of anterior subluxation of L3 on L4. The distance of the subluxation is 8.7 mm. Vertebral body heights are normal. There are some type I subchondral degenerative marrow signal changes at L4-5. There are stable benign cavernous hemangiomas at L5 and sacrum. Again there is mild to moderate loss of disc space height at L3-4 and L5-S1 and there is now further loss of disc space height which is more severe at L4-5 compared to the prior exam. T12-L1: Normal. L1-2: Normal. L2-3: Mild bulge slightly greater towards the left posterior lateral aspect with mild encroachment upon the inferior left foramina. The exiting left L2 nerve is normal. Right foraminal nerve is normal. Bilateral mild facet hypertrophy without central stenosis. L3-4: Discussed above there is greater anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 and persistent severe facet and moderate ligamentous hypertrophy. There is now greater degree of generalized thecal sac deformity and the AP diameter of the thecal sac is 5.8 mm. Bilateral moderate foraminal stenosis at this level. L4-5: Minimal bulge and mild facet hypertrophy without central canal stenosis. There is bilateral foraminal stenosis, moderate to severe bilaterally. L5-S1: Minimal bulge without mass effect. Descending S1 nerve root and thecal sac are normal. Bilateral mild to moderate facet hypertrophy with bilateral foraminal stenosis, very mild on the right and moderate to severe on the left. Conus is normal. There is crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots and this is fairly severe at L3-4. There is a stable 12 mm focus of fluid signal in the posterior cortex of the right kidney suggesting a cyst.\\r\\n\""]}

Associated subacromial subdeltoid bursitis and osseous edema. Increased signal within the subchondral glenoid fossa bone. This could suggest fissuring of the overlying cartilage although no defect is detected. Signer Name: Wyndham Owens MD Signed: 2/8/2021 2:14 PM EST Workstation Name: 4PKGMN2\\r\\nHistory Shoulder pain TECHNIQUE: Multiple multisequence MRI images the right shoulder. FINDINGS: Osseous structures are grossly intact. No acute osseous fracture or subluxation is detected. Abnormal signal is seen within the supraspinatus tendon at the footplate. Reactive edema is seen in the adjacent osseous structures. Fluid signal may extend to the bursal surface at the footplate and is seen tracking centrally within the tendon for a distance of 2.3 cm. There is subacromial subdeltoid bursal fluid. The long head biceps tendon appears to be intact and is well located the bicipital groove. There is mild AC joint arthrosis. There is a type II acromion. Increased signal seen within the glenoid fossa which is nonspecific but could suggest overlying cartilage disease. No cartilage defects detected.\\r\\n\""]}

Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound dated 7/13/2020.\\n\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Bilateral breast MR 3T imaging was performed with a dedicated 8 channel Dynacad breast coil.  Patient was  placed prone with the breast  immobilized with light compression. Following localization sequence used: T2 tirm axial fat-suppressed, T1 Axial non fat suppressed 3-D, T1 3-D fat-suppressed precontrast followed by serial T1 axial 3-D fat-suppressed post-dynamic imaging. Contrast delay of 20 seconds. Dynamic sequences were post processed to optimize radiologist interpretation by generating 3D reconstructions, subtraction images and multiplanar reformats from the dynamic contrast data at a separate Dynacad workstation.

No rotator cuff tears are evident. \\r\\n \\r\\nThere is a localized area of bone contusion in the posterior lateral femoral head.  There is a small cortical impaction fracture \\r\\nof the anterior inferior glenoid process and these bony changes are consistent with subtle Hill-Sachs and bony Bankart \\r\\nimpaction lesions from transient dislocation. \\r\\n \\r\\nThere is fluid and thickening in the anterior joint space and thickening of the glenohumeral ligaments.  A nondisplaced \\r\\nanterior and anterior-superior labral tear is suspected although somewhat difficult to differentiate from this prominent \\r\\nsublabral foramen. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe long head of the biceps tendon is intact.

Left shoulder pain COMPARISONS: Radiographs 1/17/2021 TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, Multisequence imaging of the  left shoulder without intravenous contrast per standard departmental protocol.  FINDINGS: There is edematous arthrosis of the distal AC joint. On axial images it almost looks like there may be a stress fracture or recent traumatic fracture nondisplaced see image 2-22. There is also some mild periosteal reaction suggested. The acromion is horizontal with a 7 mm acromiohumeral interval Equivocal fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa The rotator cuff muscles, demonstrate some mild fatty involution of the infraspinatus with mild circumferential rotator cuff tendinosis but no actual tears. There is a tiny less than 3 mm intramuscular ganglion involving the posterior supraspinatus without any reaction around it. The biceps tendon resides in its normal groove with intact biceps labral anchor There is some motion, no gross labral tear is demonstrated Stress-related changes are demonstrated along the superior and posterior humeral head. Minimal joint effusion with mild age-appropriate cartilage thinning. No loose bodies. No axillary adenopathy\\r\\n\""]}

Therefore the transitional vertebra is considered partially lumbarized S1 vertebra. Borderline mild acquired central canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 which is slightly increased at L4-5 because of ligamentous hypertrophy especially on the right. Nonspecific mild edema involving the left posterior paraspinal muscles from L2 through L4 levels. Although nonspecific this could be related to a strain. Signer Name: Douglas Kaffenberger, MD Signed: 2/9/2021 3:18 PM EST Workstation Name: B7FK243\\r\\nExam:MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY: Lumbar radiculopathy COMPARISON:MRI lumbar spine from 11/27/2018, CT lumbar spine from 7/9/2015 and CT of the chest from 8/17/2020. Views: Routine multiecho and multiplanar images. FINDINGS: There is a transitional vertebra and there also appears to be small ribs at the L1 level when considering CT of the chest demonstrated 12 normal ribs with a small periventricular ribs at L1. Therefore the transitional vertebra is considered partially lumbarized S1 vertebra. Alignment, and vertebral body heights as well as signal from the osseous marrow elements are normal. Stable mild to moderate loss of disc space height at L5-S1. L1-2: Normal. L2-3: Normal. L3-4: No bulge or herniation. There is mild ligamentous and mild to moderate facet hypertrophy which generalized mild thecal sac attenuation which appears fairly stable. Foraminal nerves appear normal. L4-5: No bulge or herniation. Mild to moderate facet hypertrophy. There is moderate ligamentous hypertrophy although this is somewhat increased especially on the right side since the prior study. There is generalized mild thecal sac attenuation somewhat greater along the right lateral aspect of the thecal sac. There is mild bilateral foraminal stenosis and foraminal nerves are normal. L5-S1: Stable thickening of the right lamina. No bulge or herniation or central stenosis. Foraminal nerves appear normal. The conus is normal. There is some mild crowding of the cauda equina nerve roots at L4-5. Visualized paraspinal structures shows some subtle areas of hazy increased T2 signal suggesting some edema involving the left posterior paraspinal muscles from superior L2 to the superior L4 level. This is best visualized on sagittal images #2 through #5 on series #401. There is no associated circumscribed fluid collection.\\r\\n\""]}

CT thorax May 5, 2020.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was performed through the thoracic spine using standard protocol.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nOsseous structures: No spondylolisthesis has developed. Multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis.  \\n\\nSubacute appearing compression fracture at T11 with persistent marrow edema is new from radiographs of December 15, 2020. This is associated with up to 50% loss of vertebral body height anteriorly but no visible osseous retropulsion.\\n\\nSubtly increased anterior wedging of the T1 vertebral body compared to the CT C-spine from 12/15/2020, however no marrow edema persists within the superior endplate.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury. The previously visualized renal cysts are not appreciated on this exam, likely outside the field-of-view.\\n\\nCanal contents: Multilevel cord surface deformities attributable to spondylosis. Cord caliber and signal are normal.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal. Scattered small disc protrusions apparent with at most mild central canal stenosis, most prominent at T11-T12 where the central canal measures 8 mm in AP diameter.\\nMultilevel foraminal narrowing appears at most mild, most advanced in the lower thoracic spine below T9.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\n1.  Subacute appearing compression fracture at T11, partially visualized on recent MRI.\\n2.  Multilevel thoracic spondylosis, most prominent at T11-T12 where the spinal canal measures 8 mm AP diameter.\\n3.  T1 anterior wedge compression deformity does not exhibit persistent edema to suggest recent change, however the anterior wedging appears mildly progressed from most recent CT of December 15, 2020.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nPLATTEMP-33-50\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             02/08/2021 09:35\\nResident: Wilhoit MD Res, Kenan T\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Vertebral bodies are of normal height and signal intensity.  The conus terminates at L1-L2 and demonstrates normal signal intensity. Included paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. T12-L1: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L1-L2: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L2-L3: Mild foraminal and extraforaminal disc bulge. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. L3-L4: Mild foraminal and extraforaminal disc bulge. No spinal canal narrowing. Unchanged minimal neural foraminal narrowing. L4-L5: Broad-based disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac and in combination with facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening causes unchanged mild spinal canal narrowing. Disc material, posterior osteophytic ridging and facet hypertrophy cause unchanged mild neural foraminal narrowing, left more prominent than right. Unchanged small right facet effusion with bilateral facet degenerative changes. L5-S1: No disc bulge. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. Unchanged facet degenerative changes.

No significant retropulsion of fragments is seen. Disc protrusion at L1-2 causes severe left lateral recess stenosis. Disc extrusion at L5-S1 is seen cephalad with mild mass effect on the left transitioning nerve roots. Enhancement of fluid collection again seen at the L4-5 disc space. This has enlarged slightly compared prior examination with increased signal abnormality within the adjacent vertebral bodies. Imaging appearance is concerning for an infected fluid collection as previously suggested. Clinical correlation for signs of infection is recommended. Signer Name: Wyndham Owens MD Signed: 2/2/2021 3:28 PM EST Workstation Name: DH1TCP2\\r\\nHistory HISTORY: Impression fracture of the L-spine TECHNIQUE: Multiple multisequence MRI images of the lumbar spine without and with IV contrast. Findings The spinal cord demonstrates normal signal and morphology terminating at T12-L1. There is an acute compression fracture of L1 with greater than 50% anterior height loss. Posterior elements appear be spared. Fluid collection is again seen within the L4-5 disc space with extension into the epidural space on the right and into the left anterior iliopsoas muscle. One fluid collection seen in the right subarticular zone measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm. The fluid collection within the left psoas muscle region measures 3.9 x 1.3 cm. These are more prominent than on previous examination. T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense signal is seen within the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies demonstrating postcontrast enhancement. This is more prominent than on previous examination. Postsurgical changes are seen within the paraspinous musculature at L4-5. T12-L1: Posterior disc bulge with mild mass effect on the anterior thecal sac L1-2: Left paracentral and subarticular disc protrusion likely impinging the transitioning nerve roots in the lateral recess. Moderate left neuroforaminal stenosis. L2-3: Disc desiccation with disc space height loss. Broad-based posterior disc and osteophyte formation. Severe right neuroforaminal stenosis. L3-4: Broad-based posterior disc bulge. Moderate neuroforaminal narrowing. Mild spinal canal narrowing. L4-5: Postsurgical changes from discectomy with interbody fusion device and posterior pedicle screws. L5-S1: Central disc protrusion with mild mass effect on the transitioning left S1 nerve root. An extrusion component appears be present extending cephalad by approximately 1.7 cm. Fatty atrophy is seen in the distal paraspinous musculature.\\r\\n\""]}

For the purposes of this study, S1 is a transitional partially lumbarized vertebra with a rudimentary S1-2 intervertebral disc. This yields the inferior most degenerative level to the L5-S1. If intervention is indicated, confirmation of the appropriate level with fluoroscopy is recommended. \\n\\nOsseous structures: Slight worsening of L5-S1 anterolisthesis attributable to degenerative facets. Otherwise, minimal multilevel spondylolisthesis attributable to degenerative facet changes with normal lumbar lordosis. Multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis.  No marrow signal edema to indicate acute injury. Similar-appearing low T2 signal in the posterior right iliac spine. The T1 sequences do not reach the rightward posterior iliac spine to evaluate T1 signal. Lumbar spinal nomenclature will follow the previously described terminology with the lowest fully formed and freely movable disc to be L5-S1. Mild multilevel Bastrop`s changes.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury.  Mild nonspecific subcutaneous dorsal T2 signal changes, likely physiologic in a recumbent patient. Expected postsurgical distortion of the dorsal soft tissues likely related to right L5-S1 synovial cyst resection.\\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at a normal level. The cauda equina is distributed as expected. Sacral Tarlov cysts.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  T12-L1: No significant disc bulge, canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.\\n          L1-2: Circumferential disc bulge with a left subarticular extrusion which contributes to mild/moderate left neuroforaminal stenosis. No significant right neural foraminal or central canal stenosis. The left paracentral foraminal zone disc extrusion appears smaller compared to March 2018.\\n  L2-3: Diffuse disc bulge with osteophyte formation, degenerative facets and ligamentous thickening. Minimal canal narrowing. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing, slightly greater on the right. Disc material slightly deflects bilateral transiting L3 nerve roots.\\n  L3-4: Diffuse disc bulge with osteophyte formation, degenerative facets and ligamentous thickening. Mild canal narrowing. Disc material the flax the bilateral transiting L4 nerve roots. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  L4-5: Asymmetric right disc bulge, degenerative facets and ligamentous thickening. Mild canal stenosis. Mild/moderate right and mild left foraminal narrowing.\\n  L5-S1: Grade 1 anterolisthesis with disc uncovering and bulge in conjunction with moderate hypertrophic facet arthropathy contributes to moderate right neuroforaminal stenosis where the exiting L5 nerve root contacts the protruding disc (series 2 image 12). Mild left neuroforaminal stenosis. No significant central canal stenosis. Interval surgical excision of the L5-S1 synovial cyst.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\nAttention: Transitional anatomy present. For the purposes of this study, S1 is a transitional partially lumbarized vertebra with a rudimentary S1-2 intervertebral disc. This yields the inferior most degenerative level to the L5-S1. If intervention is indicated, confirmation of the appropriate level with fluoroscopy is recommended. \\n \\nInterval surgical excision of the large right L5-S1 synovial cyst with improved canal and foraminal caliber. Since the prior study, there has been slight worsening of hypertrophic facet arthropathy and a subtle anterolisthesis resulting in moderate right foraminal stenosis. Superimposed mild inflammatory facet arthropathy on the right at L5-S1 may contribute to focal pain.\\n\\nInterval subtotal involution of the L1-L3 disc extrusions.

Smooth contour. No suspicious focal lesion.\\nBile Ducts: Extrahepatic bile duct measuring up to 17 mm with similar tapering to the ampulla, unchanged. \\nGallbladder: Cholecystectomy.\\nPancreas: Numerous cystic lesions, largest in the tail measuring 2.8 x 1.7 cm (series 7 image 16), in the body measuring up to 1.3 cm on the same image, 1.7 cm in the pancreatic head (series 7 image 29) and 8 mm in the uncinate. Majority of these demonstrate ductal communication, likely side branch IPMN`s, while others do not definitely communicate. No ductal dilatation or solid nodular enhancing component. However, there is suspected mild smoothly marginated thickening and hyperenhancement of the posterior wall of the largest pancreatic tail lesion such as seen on series 29, image 37 (considered a worrisome feature per Fukuoka guidelines). There is also suspected mild circumferential smoothly marginated wall thickening and hyperenhancement of one of the inferior downstream pancreatic tail cystic lesions on series 29, image 42 measuring up to 1.2 cm, likely corresponding to a heterogenous mildly T2 hyperintense lesion seen on series 8, image 21. Of note, this 1.2 cm cystic lesion would likely be difficult to accurately separate from other pancreatic cystic lesions via EUS due to number of pancreatic cysts. No definite enhancing mural nodularity or frankly malignant features.\\n\\nSpleen: Mildly enlarged at 15 cm craniocaudal with T2 signal compatible with secondary hemachromatosis. No focal lesion.\\nAdrenals: No significant abnormality.\\nKidneys: At least moderate left renal cortical atrophy. Previously demonstrated exophytic indeterminate renal midpole lesion measures 1.2 cm on series 7, image 24, similar to prior, with mild T1 homogeneous hyperintensity. An additional 1.8 cm mildly T2 hyperintense homogeneous right lower pole intraparenchymal lesion is seen on series 6, image 30 with T1 hypointensity. These show no obvious enhancement on subtraction images, compatible with proteinaceous/hemorrhagic cysts.\\n\\nAn exophytic posterior left superior pole renal lesion measures 1.4 cm on series 7, image 14, predominantly homogeneous with mild T2 hyperintensity, homogeneous T1 isointensity, and mild diffusion restriction. Lesion shows suspected subtle enhancement in the intraparenchymal component such as seen on series 29, image 33, but not definitely in the exophytic component, although difficult to assess due to small size. Alternatively, this hypoenhancing intraparenchymal component could be a separate abutting lesion measuring about 1.1 cm. The other lesions show no significant diffusion restriction.\\n\\nAdditionally, a T2 hyperintense cystic left lower pole renal lesion measuring 1.5 cm (series 6 image 25) likely has multiple thin internal septations, without suspicious enhancement, Bosniak 2. A few significantly bright T1 hyperintense tiny right renal lesions are compatible with proteinaceous/hemorrhagic cysts. Other bilateral renal lesions including large exophytic right superior pole lesions have characteristic appearances of simple cysts.\\n\\nVisualized Bowel/Peritoneum: Ventral abdominal wall bowel containing hernia without evidence of obstruction.\\nLymph Nodes: No lymphadenopathy.\\nAorta: No abdominal aortic aneurysm. \\n\\nOther findings: Partially visualized 4 cm cystic focus posterior to the left iliacus muscle (series 6, image 26) extends towards the left hip joint and shows mild rim enhancement, likely related to left hip osteoarthritis.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nMultiple pancreatic cystic lesions as described, most likely branch duct type IPMNs. 2 of the larger pancreatic tail cystic lesions show worrisome features, without frank malignancy/high risk stigmata. Consider EUS with FNA of at least the largest lesion. At minimum, follow-up pancreatic protocol MRI will be needed in 6 months.\\n\\nA single small left superior pole lesion is indeterminate, complex cyst versus early renal cell carcinoma, slightly favor renal cell carcinoma. This can be followed on future MR examinations (unless a more aggressive approach is clinically desired), assuming patient will continue to undergo MRI for pancreatic cystic lesions. At minimum, patient need follow-up renal protocol in 1 year to exclude a growing renal cell carcinoma. Otherwise, there are simple and proteinaceous/hemorrhagic renal cysts as described.\\n\\nFindings of secondary hemochromatosis.\\n\\nLeft pelvic cystic focus/collection, likely related to left hip osteoarthritis.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nH2NBB03\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: DEWITT MD, CHERYL D                         02/03/2021 10:39\\nResident: Chirico Jr MD Res, Nicholas\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. T2/flair hyperintensities throughout the periventricular white matter are nonspecific but compatible with mild microangiopathic changes. Global parenchymal atrophy is mild to moderate, grossly within physiologic expectations for patient age. Ventricular volumes are mildly prominent. Although this may be entirely extra-axial due to atrophy, this is greater than expected given the degree of atrophy such that the possibility of normal pressure hydrocephalus is not excluded. There is also an exaggerated flow-void of the cerebral aqueduct, a finding which may also indicate communicating hydrocephalus. No pathologic parenchymal enhancement is identified on postcontrast images. The expected physiologic basilar flow-voids are intact. Circumferential mucosal thickening is in the left maxillary sinus and anterior left ethmoid air cells, with mild scattered mucosal thickening elsewhere in the paranasal sinuses.\\r\\n\""]}

Images acquired before and after the intravenous and ministration of 25 mL ProHance\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nOsseous structures: Postoperative changes at L1-2, and L2-3 through L4-5 with superior laminotomy and inferior laminectomy. Subtle left convex curvature. Subtle L4-5 spondylolisthesis attributable to degenerative facet changes, remaining alignment preserved. Mild multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis.  Minor multilevel reactive marrow signal changes without findings to indicate acute injury nor significant pathology. Minor inflammatory changes at the L4-5 facets.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury. Expected postsurgical distortion of the dorsal soft tissues in a laminectomy patient. T2 intense renal lesions are most likely cysts.\\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at a normal level. The cauda equina is distributed as expected. Following the administration of contrast, there is a short segment enhancing tubular structure with small tufts of intrinsic T1 shortening extending to the adjacent nerve roots at the superior and inferior extents extending from L1-2 to L2-3.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  L1-2: Post surgical decompression.

No canal or left foraminal narrowing.\\n  L3-4: Postlaminectomy. Minor disc bulge and degenerative facet changes. Minimal right and no left foraminal narrowing. No canal stenosis.\\n  L4-5: Postlaminectomy. Minor disc bulge with central extrusion. No canal stenosis. Minimal left greater than right foraminal narrowing.\\n  L5-S1: Tiny central protrusion. No canal stenosis. Degenerative facet changes. No significant foraminal narrowing.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.  The patient has had a multilevel laminectomy without fusion hardware. This may indicate surgery was for tumor removal as there is nonspecific abnormal signal within the cauda equina. Correlation with surgical history necessary. There is a residual short segment tubular enhancement with proximal and distal T1 shortening that does not fat suppress. Mostly, the morphology and appearance suggest filum lipoma with enhancing engorged vessel however the lack of fat suppression may indicate proteinaceous fluid and a residual cystic lesion. Given there is no prior imaging to assess for long-term stability, continued follow-up recommended to best confirm long-term stability.\\n2.  Otherwise, minor spondylosis with no significant canal narrowing and no greater than mild foraminal narrowing, as discussed.\\n\\nPLAT-BUILD-BC1\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: GRAY MD, RICHARD I                          02/03/2021 08:53\\n\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Apparent subtle interval enlargement of the centrally cystic pituitary lesion described on prior imaging.

No acute intracranial abnormality. Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 2/1/2021 9:20 AM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHistory: Benign neoplasm of the pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the pituitary without and with 10 cc Gadavist IV contrast. COMPARISON: MRI brain September 4, 2015. FINDINGS: The diffusion weighted sequence demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct. The GRE sequence demonstrates no evidence of pathologic hemosiderin deposition. No hydrocephalus, mass effect, or extra-axial collection has developed. No pathologic enhancement is identified on postcontrast images the brain parenchyma. The pituitary gland is essentially unchanged in morphology from the prior examination. A T2 hyperintense lesion with central hypoenhancement suggesting cystic/necrotic change is again identified in the inferior portion of the pituitary gland to the right of midline, measuring up to approximately 6 mm AP by 5 mm craniocaudal on image 8 of series 1001, and measuring approximately 6 mm lateral dimension on coronal image 5 series 1101. Although appearing mildly enlarged from the prior examination, this may be secondary to MR technique and improved spatial resolution of the current study rather than true growth.\\r\\n\""]}

Vertebral body heights well-maintained. Multilevel Schmorl`s nodes are slightly better. No lumbar marrow signal edema to indicate acute injury. No findings to indicate significant marrow pathology. Better placement of the L5 pedicle marrow compatible with prior inflammation. Mild degenerative facet changes at L4-5 bilaterally. There is, however, right sacral alla STIR signal intensity, incompletely evaluated on this study.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury.  Abundant stool in distal colon. Bladder wall thickening of indeterminate significance again identified.\\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at a normal level. The cauda equina is distributed as expected.\\n\\nDisc levels: Disc height and signal well-maintained.\\n  L1-2: No significant disc bulge, canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L2-3: No significant disc bulge, canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L3-4: Incomplete skeletal development augments disc rounding. No significant canal or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L4-5: Incomplete skeletal development, minor disc bulge and central protrusion. Degenerative facets contribute to mild right and minimal left foraminal narrowing.\\n  L5-S1: Incomplete skeletal development with mild disc undulation. No canal stenosis. Possible early asymmetric left degenerative facet changes contribute to minimal left foraminal narrowing.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.  There is subtle abnormal sacral alla STIR signal intensity. While possibly artifactual, if there is pelvic pain this may represent stress related injury or mild inflammation not otherwise well characterized on this study. If symptomatic, dedicated pelvic imaging would allow for improved characterization of the sacral alla and SI joints.\\n2.  Otherwise, expected evolution of previously seen findings.

Findings There is full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear at the footplate which may involve the anterior infraspinatus fibers. The tear extends at least 1.4 cm anterior posterior by 1.3 cm mediolateral. There is subscapularis tendinosis. No muscular fatty atrophy is detected. AC joint is normal in appearance There is a type I acromion. No mass effect is seen on the rotator cuff. Postsurgical changes are seen from previous rotator cuff repair. Intermediate signal seen within the anterior superior labrum which represent degenerative fraying. If there is clinical concern for tear, MR arthrography could be helpful for further characterization. No acute osseous fracture or subluxation is detected. No neurovascular pathology is seen. The cartilaginous surface of the glenohumeral joint is mildly thickened.\\r\\n\""]}

One month history of altered mental status which began approximately one month ago with associated anorexia, arthralgias, fatigue, and weakness. History of type 2 diabetes, breast cancer status post right mastectomy, history of hypertension, COMPARISON: CT head 8/9/2019 and 8/14/2016 TECHNIQUE: Multisequence, multiplanar unenhanced MRI brain FINDINGS: There is no diffusion restriction to suggest acute ischemia. Very subtle hemosiderin staining on the gradient echo weighted sequence outlining the anterior and posterior sulcus right posterior frontal lobe, best demonstrated around image 19 of series 7 is at the site of prior subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2016, not unusual. More prominent susceptibility artifacts correspond to previously demonstrated dystrophic calcifications right caudate head and anterior limb internal capsule basal ganglia junction. Little susceptibility associated with mild calcifications in the globus pallidus previously bilaterally and single previously demonstrated coarse calcification deep white matter at the left frontoparietal junction. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Mild to moderate primarily periventricular chronic microvascular ischemic changes again noted, not significantly progressed accounting for differences in modality compared with the prior CT in 2019. The brain signal characteristics are otherwise unremarkable. There is no evidence of a mass or midline shift. Volume loss and ex vacuo ventricular dilatation are proportional. Cisterns are patent. The left vertebral artery is dominant at the foramen magnum, which is not unusual and unchanged. No mastoid air cell effusion. Changes of prior bilateral cataract surgery again noted. The posterior fossa and craniocervical junction are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute ischemia. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes and other chronic findings, unchanged from prior head CT exams, the most recent in 2019. Age-related volume loss and proportional ventricular dilatation, not significantly progressed, either. No new/significant abnormalities otherwise.

Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 1/29/2021 4:06 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHistory: Ringing in left ear. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain/IAC without and with 9.5 cc Gadavist IV contrast. COMPARISON: CT head November 14, 2019. FINDINGS: T2/FLAIR hyperintensities scattered throughout the periventricular and subcortical white matter are nonspecific but compatible with moderate microangiopathic changes. Global parenchymal atrophy is mild. The diffusion weighted sequence demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. No pathologic parenchymal enhancement is identified on the postcontrast images. Evidence of bilateral ocular lens replacement. A large volume left mastoid effusion is demonstrated on temporal bone imaging. The pneumatized left petrous apex is also opacified with fluid. Semicircular canals appear symmetric in signal without pathologic enhancement. Cochlea appears normal in morphology and symmetric bilaterally. No IAC or cerebellopontine angle mass is detected on either side. No pathologic enhancement is detected in either IAC or cerebellopontine angle on postcontrast images.\\r\\n\""]}

Large serpiginous low T1 and high T2 signal intensity lesion with central fat signal intensity extending from the anterior to posterior lateral femoral condyle measuring up to 4.8 x 2 x 1.5 cm in AP, craniocaudal, and transverse dimensions is noted, compatible with avascular necrosis. A smaller lesion with similar signal intensity in the posterior weightbearing surface of medial femoral condyle is also noted. Mild marrow edema surrounding both lesions is seen. A lobular low T1 and high T2-weighted signal intensity lesion along the lateral cortex of distal femoral metaphysis measuring up to 9 x 15 x 7 mm with a few small foci of internal low T2 signal intensity is most compatible with cartilage rest.

Signer Name: Noel M Bergquist MD Signed: 1/26/2021 4:52 PM EST Workstation Name: B7FJ243\\r\\nMRI LUMBAR SPINE W-O HISTORY: Intermittent pain worsening. No radiculopathy COMPARISONS:  7/6/2010 TECHNIQUE:  Parasagittal T1, T2, STIR, Axial T1, T2, Coronal T2 scout. FINDINGS: There is a mild straightening of the normal lordotic curve which is stable and compared to previous evaluation. Vertebral body heights are maintained along with marrow signal intensities. Disc desiccation changes are demonstrated L4-S1. L4 Schmorl`s node is stable. Fatty endplate changes at L5-S1 also stable although there is progressive height loss and disc desiccation change. The conus is normal morphology and signal intensity sitting at the T12 level. T12-L1:  Unremarkable L1-2:  Mild left neuroforaminal stenosis L2-3:  Patent canal and neuroforamina with mild facet arthropathy L3-4:  Patent canal and neuroforamina with mild facet arthropathy L4-5:  Circumferential disc bulge and mild facet arthropathy with partial effacement lateral recesses but no clear compromise of the exiting or descending nerve roots L5-S1:  Patient appears to be status post a right micro laminotomy. Soft tissue in the right lateral recess which appears to have mass effect on the thecal sac is likely epidural fibrosis but a disc extrusion is not excluded. This appears to be abutting and affecting the descending right L5 nerve root. Postcontrast images would be beneficial to differentiate these 2 processes. The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.\\r\\n\""]}

Views: Routine multiecho, multiplanar images, DWI and SWI images. FINDINGS: There is a 12 mm oval-shaped focus of restricted diffusion in the right anterior pons. There is another 6 mm focus of milder increased DWI signal involving left parietal deep white matter and is of intermediate signal on ADC sequence. This is of well-defined lower signal on T1 sequence. There is another 2 mm rounded focus of mild increased DWI and intermediate ADC signal in the posterior superior left frontal deep white matter. There are areas of increased FLAIR signal corresponding to the signal abnormalities on the DWI sequence in addition to moderate periventricular white matter areas of increased FLAIR signal and a few other punctate foci involving the centrum semiovale deep white matter of the superior frontal and parietal white matter areas bilaterally. There is a punctate focus of CSF signal within the right thalamus. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal for the patient`s age. Optic pathway structures appear normal. Visualized vessels are patent with some intermediate signal involving the distal left M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery corresponding to the angiographic finding which is likely related to either short segment occlusion or very severe stenosis of the distal left M1 segment since there is flow distally within the sylvian branches. There is small focus of fluid signal involving posterior left ethmoid air cell.

The degree of cord deformity is also significantly improved. Persistent subtle indentation of the ventral cord at C7 without evidence of cord edema or cord hemorrhage. Extensive posterior intramuscular edema associated with spinous process fractures and elsewhere in the region of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments is similar to prior MRI. Prevertebral edema has developed, likely related to ACDF.\\n\\nThere is a thin residual circumferential extradural hematoma at C7 without significant contribution to spinal stenosis at this time.\\n\\nAt C2-C3, degenerative facets and disc osteophyte complex contributes to right greater than left foraminal stenosis.

There is moderate central canal stenosis, unchanged.\\n\\nAt C5-C6 there is moderate central canal stenosis with an AP diameter of approximately 8 mm and severe bilateral foraminal stenosis, difficult to characterize given to susceptibility artifact.\\n\\nAt C6-C7, no significant canal stenosis. Osseous fragments with right-sided jumped and locked facet is unchanged. Subluxation and bony fragments narrow the left-sided neural foramen.\\n\\nAt C7-T1, there is persistent moderate central canal stenosis without significant foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\nPostoperative changes from interval C5-T2 ACDF with persistent but improved cervical spine malalignment, centered at C7-T1, with additional improved traumatic cord deformity. No evidence of cord hemorrhage or other signal abnormality to suggest acute cord injury.\\n\\nMultiple cervical spine fractures with evidence of extensive ligamentous injury and persistent jumped and locked right C6-C7 facet.\\n\\nResidual extradural hemorrhage at the C7 level is grossly similar in volume to the prior study, without significant contribution to spinal stenosis at this time.\\n\\nOther severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine with improved canal stenosis from prior exam but varying degrees of foraminal stenosis as described.

Pre and postcontrast images were also obtained and parasagittal and axial reformats. FINDINGS: Involvement of the L3 vertebral body with neoplastic process is stable when compared to previous evaluation. There is no evidence for progression of the infiltrating process or collapse of the vertebral body. No expansion into the paraspinal musculature epidural space. There is a straightened lordosis with maintained vertebral body heights. Above and below the L3 level marrow signal intensities are normal other than some very subtle endplate changes which are degenerative in nature. The central canal is widely patent The conus is normal morphology and signal intensity sitting at T12-L1 and the neuroforamina are patent. They do begin to narrow especially at the L5-S1 level on the left probably due to a disc protrusion. Small facet effusions are demonstrated L3-4 and L4-5 Previously demonstrated retroperitoneal adenopathy continues to improve. The mesenteric mass is suboptimally evaluated\\r\\n\""]}

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, Multisequence imaging of the  left shoulder without intravenous contrast per standard departmental protocol.  FINDINGS: There is moderately severe hypertrophic changes of the intact acromioclavicular joint with infralateral acromion and a 4 mm acromiohumeral interval. No distention the subacromial subdeltoid bursa is demonstrated. Name rotator cuff muscles are normal in bulk and signal intensity. Insertional tendinosis is demonstrated involving the critical zone and insertion of the supraspinatus. Otherwise the rotator cuff is intact and unremarkable. The biceps tendon is not identified with a complete biceps labral anchor tear. There is extensive degenerative tearing of the glenoid labrum which is appropriate for the underlying osteoarthritis There is a very severe osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral articulation with remodeling of the articular surface, exuberant spurring and subchondral cyst formation. Exuberant osteophytes are demonstrated off of the inferior posterior humeral head. This is associated with a large joint effusion and synovitis. Moderate subchondral cyst formation along the greater tuberosity No axillary adenopathy\\r\\n\""]}

FINDINGS: There are diffuse signal abnormalities throughout the visualized skeleton consistent with metastatic disease. This involves every vertebral body level as well as visualized sacrum. There is a burst fracture of the L1 vertebral body which does not appear particularly acute although is new from 2015 and has likely progressed compared to a scout radiograph from a CT-guided biopsy on 8/17/2020. There is significant retropulsion of fragments by approximately 7 mm and results in mild-to-moderate central canal narrowing with AP canal diameter of 8 mm. There is at least moderate disc space narrowing throughout the lumbar spine with mild osteophytic ridging and associated disc bulging and moderate facet arthropathy. No significant central canal stenosis although there is some mild-to-moderate foraminal narrowing, most significant on the left at L5-S1 with at least moderate stenosis.\\r\\n\""]}

Low back pain.\\n\\nComparison: 6/23/2020.\\n\\nFindings:\\n\\nSince the prior exam, the patient has undergone a left hemilaminectomy, partial facetectomy and foraminotomy and presumed discectomy at the L3-L4 level. There is fairly extensive enhancement along the paraspinal dissection plane in the laminectomy bed, as well as some enhancing soft tissue along the leftward thecal sac, facetectomy bed and foramen consistent with an element of fibrosis. Mild enhancement is seen within the left posterior disc space consistent with a limited discectomy. There is some enhancement surrounding the rightward facet as well as well as some mild enhancement surrounding the disc space and minimal adjacent endplates but no significant enhancement within the disc itself or destruction of the endplates to suggest infection. No residual or recurrent disc herniation is appreciated with the left foramina patent and no significant mass effect within the central canal.\\n\\nThe remainder the lumbar spine was unchanged with again some mild degenerative disc bulging and facet arthropathy at L1-L2, L2-L3. L4-L5 shows some moderate facet arthropathy as does L5-S1. No neural compression/significant stenosis at these levels however.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\n1. Postsurgical changes at L3-L4 as described, with no residual/recurrent disc/mass effect/significant stenosis. There is fairly extensive enhancement along the dissection plane and within the surgical beds consistent with some postsurgical granulation tissue/fibrosis. In addition, there is some inflammatory change surrounding the facets in general, including the right, as well as surrounding the disc space suggesting an element of active inflammation. There is no bony destruction or other changes to suggest infection however the findings may raise the possibility of microinstability and clinical correlation is requested. Flexion and extension views may be useful.\\n\\n2.

Patient was  placed prone with the breast  immobilized with light compression. Following localization sequence used: T2 SPAIR axial fat-suppressed, T1 Axial non fat suppressed 3-D, T1 3-D fat-suppressed precontrast followed by serial T1 axial 3-D fat-suppressed post-dynamic imaging. Contrast delay of 20 seconds. Dynamic sequences were post processed to optimize radiologist interpretation by generating 3D reconstructions, subtraction images and multiplanar reformats from the dynamic contrast data at a separate DynaCad workstation.

FINDINGS: The femoral head is round, articulating normally with the acetabulum which demonstrates mild relatively uniform, superior cartilage thinning. There is no significant joint effusion. No clear labral tear. No para labral cyst demonstrated Mild for age tendinosis of the insertion of the gluteus minimus and medius No iliopsoas or greater trochanteric bursitis demonstrated on either side Pelvic soft tissues are grossly unremarkable with a mild nodular hypertrophy of the central prostate. This is not a prostate MRI There is a partial-thickness annular tear at the L4-5 level with broad-based disc protrusion, incompletely assessed. Mild degenerative changes at L5-S1 are also present changes of a laminotomy on the left at L4-5 and a laminectomy at L5-S1. Previously described marrow lesions compatible with multiple myeloma are significantly smaller. Right iliac crest today measures 6.5 mm in diameter (previously 10 mm). The left symphysis pubis lesion previously measuring 5 mm on today`s study measures approximately 2 mm. The L5 lesion appears to demonstrate some degree of healing, greatest craniocaudal dimension now measuring 9 mm, previously measuring 2.5 cm. There is a left iliac lesion adjacent to the SI joint on image 403-31 which is larger, today measuring 7 mm (previously measuring 5 mm). This does not demonstrate enhancement.

Vertebral body heights well-maintained. Edema marginates the left C4-C5 facet joint where there is a small joint effusion. This is nonspecific but likely degenerative in origin given the presence of large hypertrophic osteophytes. Diffusely T1 dark vertebral bone marrow, as described on same day MRI T and L spine report.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: Limited imaging of the intracranial contents is unremarkable. No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury. Incomplete fat suppression adjacent to C1/C2. Well-circumscribed T1/T2 high signal soft tissue mass within the right paraspinal musculature is again appreciated although not fully imaged on this exam.\\n\\nCanal contents: Multilevel cord surface deformities attributable to spondylosis. Cord caliber and signal is normal, other than at C5-6 where there is mildly increased T2/STIR signal within the cord.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  C2-3: No significant osteophytic ridging or canal stenosis. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to left greater than right foraminal narrowing.\\n  C3-4: Central disc osteophyte complex closely approaches the ventral cord surface. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to right greater than left foraminal narrowing.\\n  C4-5: Small disc bulge without significant canal stenosis. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to left greater than right foraminal narrowing.\\n  C5-6: Diffuse disc bulge with small central protrusion and associated osteophytes effaces the normal CSF spaces and contribute to cord flattening, the central canal measures 5 mm in the AP plane at this level. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to right greater than left foraminal narrowing.\\n  C6-7: Right central disc protrusion superimposed upon a diffuse disc bulge abuts and deforms the ventral cord surface to the right of midline. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to right greater than left foraminal narrowing, severe.\\n  C7-T1: No significant osteophytic ridging or canal stenosis. No significant foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. Multilevel cervical spondylosis as described above. Central canal stenosis is most severe at C5-6 where there is subtle flattening of the cord and subtle cord myelomalacia. Potentially symptomatic foraminal stenosis is present at multiple cervical levels.\\n\\n2. Redemonstration of the right paraspinal mass, please see description on MRI thoracic spine.\\n\\n3. Marrow edema marginating the left-sided C4-C5 facet where there is a facet effusion. This is favored degenerative rather than inflammatory in origin given the presence of large osteophytes at this level, but may represent a source of localized cervical pain and/or radiculopathy.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nPLATTEMP-33-50\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             01/26/2021 10:05\\nResident: Wilhoit MD Res, Kenan T\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Regional abnormality in the posterior right cerebral hemisphere. This constellation of findings is most compatible with a chronic infarct in the right posterior cerebral artery territory, with a similar but smaller focal infarct in the left occipital lobe. Correlation with patient history is suggested. If there is no prior history of no acute infarct, correlation with a contrast-enhanced examination and surveillance is suggested to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other, significantly less common intracranial processes which might mimic chronic infarct. Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 1/20/2021 2:27 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHistory: Nontraumatic seizure. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain without contrast. COMPARISON: CT head October 11, 2012. FINDINGS: There are regional signal abnormalities throughout the posterior right temporal lobe and right occipital lobe extending into the inferior right parietal lobe consisting of areas of apparent cortical and subcortical encephalomalacia, diffuse T2 white matter signal likely representing gliosis, and gyriform cortical T1 hyperintensity and subtle susceptibility artifact suggesting chronic cortical laminar necrosis. This spectrum of findings is most suggestive of a chronic regional infarct, but is new from the prior CT. An area of similar but more localized signal abnormality is also present in the left occipital pole, favored represent chronic infarct. The diffusion weighted sequence demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct. There is ex vacuo expansion of the atrium of the right lateral ventricle, otherwise ventricular volumes are within normal limits. Global parenchymal atrophy is mild. A few T2/FLAIR hyperintensities elsewhere in the periventricular and subcortical white matter are nonspecific but compatible with chronic microangiopathic changes. The expected basilar flow-voids appear grossly intact.\\r\\n\""]}

Patient underwent diagnostic evaluation 1/18/2021 confirming suspicious segmental calcifications in the upper inner quadrant right breast. However, given patient body habitus, size and location of subglandular saline implants, breast MRI recommended to further aid with determining best method of tissue sampling.\\n\\nCOMPARISON: No prior breast MRI. Diagnostic evaluation 1/18/2021.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Bilateral breast MR 3T imaging was performed with a dedicated 16 channel Sentinel breast coil.  Patient was  placed prone with the breast  immobilized with light compression. Following localization sequence used: T2 SPAIR axial fat-suppressed, T1 Axial non fat suppressed 3-D, T1 3-D fat-suppressed precontrast followed by serial T1 axial 3-D fat-suppressed post-dynamic imaging. Contrast delay of 20 seconds. Dynamic sequences were post processed to optimize radiologist interpretation by generating 3D reconstructions, subtraction images and multiplanar reformats from the dynamic contrast data at a separate DynaCad workstation. Patient received 0.1Mm/kg Multihance IV 18 cc.\\n\\nMR FINDINGS:\\nThere is adequate bilateral contrast, and mild background parenchymal enhancement. \\n\\nThere are bilateral subglandular saline implants.\\n\\nThere is extensive abnormal regional/segmental nonmass enhancement encompassing essentially the entire upper inner quadrant right breast with some involvement of the upper central right breast as well. Total extent of enhancement is difficult to measure, at least 8-9 cm. The anterior margin of enhancement immediately at the base of the right nipple areolar complex (axial subtracted image 92). Subtle slight asymmetric enhancement of the right retroareolar complex.\\n\\nMorphologically normal right axillary lymph nodes. Right axillary/axillary tail signal dropout from prior surgical clips.\\n\\nNo suspicious enhancement in the left breast or left axilla.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 5, highly suggestive of malignancy.\\n1.  Highly suspicious extensive abnormal nonmass enhancement centered throughout the upper inner quadrant right breast extending from anterior to posterior at least 8-9 cm and abutting the base of the right nipple areolar complex. Extensive abnormal enhancement corresponds with calcification seen mammographically. Findings are worrisome for extensive underlying DCIS.\\n2.  No suspicious enhancement in the left breast or either axilla.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: \\nRecommend repeat targeted ultrasound to assess for any possible sonographic correlate which may facilitate percutaneous biopsy. In addition, attempting positioning on the prone stereotactic table utilizing lateral approach can be performed at this time to determine if stereotactic biopsy may be feasible targeting the more anterior/subareolar calcifications. Surgical referral/management may ultimately be required if percutaneous biopsy cannot be performed given limitations (patient body habitus/augmentation mammoplasty) or if attempts at percutaneous biopsy reveal discordant results.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nRAD-DICT-116-96\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\nAssessment: 5-Highly suggestive of malignancy\\n\\nAuthenticated by: DAKER MD, RASHAD                            01/21/2021 16:25\\nResident: Itkin MD RES, Alan H\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Incidental L3 vertebral body hemangioma noted along with a few scattered small nonacute appearing Schmorl`s nodes.\\n\\nAlignment is fairly well maintained and there is no evidence of pars defects.\\n\\nThe conus is normal in appearance and position. Partially visualized is a 3.5 cm T1 hyperintense rounded area the region of the leftward upper pelvis. Adjacent retroperitoneum is unremarkable.\\n\\nT12-L1, L1-L2 and L2-L3 are essentially well maintained with only trace disc bulging and no significant stenosis.\\n\\nL3-L4 shows a degenerated disc with some loss of height and mild bulging including into both foramen. Some mild to moderate facet arthropathy is noted but overall only mild central and bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, right greater than left, without neural compression appreciated.\\n\\nL4-L5 shows some mild facet arthropathy, with some active inflammation noted on the left, but is otherwise well maintained.\\n\\nL5-S1 also shows some facet arthropathy including some active appearing inflammatory changes particularly on the left.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\n1. Relatively mild degenerative changes with mild disc bulging and some facet arthropathy. I would note however that the facet arthropathy at L4-L5 and L5-S1 does appear to have some increased STIR signal/inflammation which could be a cause of axial low back pain.\\n\\n2. Very partially visualized at least 3.5 cm leftward pelvic T1 hyperintense rounded abnormality. I suspect this is arising from the left ovary/adnexa and may represent an ovarian dermoid or less likely hemorrhagic cyst. Pelvic ultrasound would be useful for complete evaluation, if this is an unknown abnormality.\\n\\nAUR-HOME\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: GASH MD, JUDSON R                           01/22/2021 21:18\\n\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 1/18/2021 2:06 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHISTORY: Restaging non-small cell lung cancer of the right lower lobe. Malignant neoplasm of temporal and frontal lobes of brain. Technique: MRI of the brain without and with 7.5 cc Gadavist IV contrast. COMPARISON: October 19, 2019. FINDINGS: Hemorrhagic right frontal lesion with a rim of intrinsic T1 hyperintensity appears unchanged in volume from the comparison study, measuring up to approximately 2.6 x 2.3 cm in axial dimension with a rim of dense hemosiderin deposition. No definite enhancement superimposed upon the hemorrhagic signal changes is detected. Surrounding T2/FLAIR hyperintensity likely representing gliosis and/or edema is unchanged from the comparison study. The enhancing lesion of the left cerebellar hemisphere is mildly increased in size from the prior examination, currently measuring approximately 8 x 5 mm on image 28 of series 1003. Associated localized edema is unchanged. Enhancing lesion in the posterior right frontal centrum semiovale is unchanged from the prior study, measuring 6 mm long axis dimension. Confluent T2/FLAIR hyperintensity elsewhere in the periventricular and subcortical white matter is similar to the prior examination, likely reflecting a combination of posttherapeutic signal changes and underlying microangiopathic change. No new lesion is detected. No acute infarct is identified on the diffusion-weighted sequence. No focal marrow replacing lesion is identified. Paranasal sinuses are essentially clear.\\r\\n\""]}

Multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis. A superior endplate compression deformity at L5 with up to 30% loss of vertebral body height retains endplate edema and is likely subacute in age. Mild degenerative endplate changes elsewhere in the lumbar spine.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: No evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury.  Mild nonspecific subcutaneous dorsal T2 signal changes, likely physiologic in a recumbent patient. Subcentimeter T2 hyperintense renal cortical lesions are likely to represent cysts.\\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at a normal level. The cauda equina is distributed as expected.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  L1-2: Concentric disc bulge with ligamentum flavum thickening minimally narrow the central canal. Mild facet arthropathy contributes to mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  L2-3: Eccentric disc bulge larger on the left with associated osteophytes and mild facet arthropathy mildly narrow the central canal. There is mild right and moderate left foraminal narrowing with possible abutment of the posterior aspect of the exiting L2 nerve root.\\n  L3-4: Dextroscoliosis, eccentric disc bulge larger on the left with associated osteophytes, and facet arthropathy also contribute to moderate central canal narrowing to approximately 7 mm in AP dimension with crowding of the descending nerve roots. Left foraminal focal extrusion contributes to severe left foraminal narrowing at this level, with moderate to severe narrowing on the right secondary to facet arthropathy.\\n  L4-5: Eccentric disc bulge larger on the right with right foraminal disc extrusion with superior migration minimally narrows the central canal, but along with facet arthropathy severely narrows the right neuroforamen. There is mild left foraminal narrowing.\\n  L5-S1: Concentric disc bulge and ligamentous hypertrophy minimally narrow the central canal. This along with facet arthropathy results in moderate/severe bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\n1. Multilevel lumbar spondylosis with scoliosis as described above. This is most advanced at L3-4 and L4-5 where disc bulges along with superimposed foraminal disc extrusions and facet arthropathy result in severe foraminal narrowing on the left at L3-4 and on the right at L4-5. Clinical correlation for associated radiculopathies is suggested.\\n2. Superior endplate fracture at L5 retains a band of edema, suggesting it is likely subacute in age. This is associated with up to approximately 30% loss of vertebral body height.

Normal excretion of contrast on hepatobiliary phase.\\nBile Ducts: Mildly dilated common hepatic duct measuring up to 11 mm and minimal central left intrahepatic biliary dilatation above this of uncertain etiology, without discrete focal stricture. Normal common bile duct caliber at 5 mm. Normal tapering at the ampulla without choledocholithiasis. \\nGallbladder: Hydropic gallbladder. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.\\nPancreas: Pancreatic T1 signal is preserved. Multiple subcentimeter cystic lesions in the pancreas, most pronounced in the head/uncinate process measuring up to 7 mm on series 22 image 30 with possible main pancreatic ductal communication. Other smaller cystic lesions do not demonstrate clear indication of pancreatic duct. No suspicious postcontrast enhancement. No evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilatation or acute pancreatitis.\\nSpleen: No splenomegaly. \\nAdrenals: No significant abnormality.\\nKidneys: No significant abnormality.\\n\\nVisualized Bowel/Peritoneum: There appears to be a rim-enhancing collection or tract extending from the inferior aspect of the D1 duodenum (series 21, image 27 and series 15, image 51) along the anterior pancreatic head and neck with probable tiny connection to the anteromedial D2 duodenum (series 20, image 15). Area measures at least 2.6 x 1.9 cm on series 15, image 53 and fills with hepatobiliary contrast from the duodenum on 20 minute images, compatible with continuity with the bowel. There is very subtle surrounding fat stranding. The visualized small and large bowel show no abnormal dilatation.\\nLymph Nodes: No lymphadenopathy.\\nAorta: No abdominal aortic aneurysm. \\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nMultiple hepatic lesions are compatible with hemangiomas.\\n\\nMultiple nonspecific pancreatic cystic lesions measuring up to 7 mm without current suspicious features, likely side branch IPMN`s.

The abnormality consists of T2 hypointense minimally enhancing abnormality surrounding the tip of the odontoid with a more focal cystic component (with peripheral enhancement ) measuring approximately 1.2 cm extending posteriorly into the canal.\\n\\nRemainder the cervical spine shows no masslike process or other acute abnormalities. There are diffuse spondylitic changes consisting of bulging discs and osteophytic ridging with some mild to moderate central stenosis at C2-C3 and C5-C6. There is diffuse facet arthropathy with several levels of moderate neural foraminal stenosis.

Innumerable peripherally enhancing and presumably metastatic lesions are again demonstrated throughout the supratentorial and infratentorial brain, exhibiting peripheral diffusion restriction due to hypercellularity. Each of these is associated with varying degrees of vasogenic edema, also grossly similar to prior CT. The largest discrete lesion in the inferior right parietal lobe measures approximately 1.8 cm in diameter. Many of these lesions are also associated with localized hemosiderin deposition.\\n\\nNo acute infarct is detected, however the multiplicity of metastatic lesions which exhibit T2 shine through and mild peripheral diffusion restriction could easily obscure acute lacunar infarct.\\n\\nThere is a moderate volume left mastoid effusion. Evidence of bilateral ocular lens replacement.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Innumerable peripherally enhancing lesions throughout the supratentorial and infratentorial brain, associated with vasogenic edema.

A more recent outside reference CT reportedly available by patient history is not available on PACS at the time of interpretation.\\n\\nFindings: Anterior superior endplate compression deformities at C7, T1, T2, T3, and T4 are new from most recent CT of the thoracic spine June 14, 2020 and from the visualized portions of the spine on CT cervical spine October 14, 2020, each with at most 20% loss of vertebral body height anteriorly but with persistent STIR hyperintensity suggesting subacute age\\n\\nIn the upper cervical spine, there are probable fractures of the left-sided articular processes at C3 and C4 with associated marrow edema and facet effusions at these levels. Grade 1 anterior subluxation of C2 relative to C3 of approximately 3 mm is likely related to these fractures, and is new from the CT of October 20, 2020. There is also mild prevertebral edema at this level with increased T2 signal in the anterior longitudinal ligament at its attachment to the C4 superior endplate suggestive of ligamentous sprain. Increased T2 signal associated with the facet joint on the left at C4-C5 suggesting ligamentous capsular injury.\\n\\nSubtle STIR hyperintensity in the posterior paraspinal musculature at C3 and C4 likely reflect ligamentous strain. No discrete soft tissue hematoma is identified. No epidural thickening or collection is detected.\\n\\nChronic grade 1 anterolisthesis at C6-C7 is unchanged from prior imaging.\\n\\nSubtle STIR hyperintensity of the rightward vertebral body at C2 is nonspecific, however given there is a C2 fracture reportedly visible on outside imaging, this could represent the site of the otherwise occult fracture.\\n\\nC2-C3: No significant spinal or foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nC3-C4: Mild subluxation, left-sided facet irregularity, and left-sided uncovertebral arthropathy contribute to moderate left-sided foraminal narrowing. No significant central canal stenosis.\\n\\nC4-C5: Small diffuse disc bulge without significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nC5-C6: Small diffuse disc bulge mildly narrows the central canal and bilateral neural foramina.\\n\\nC6-C7: Grade 1 anterolisthesis, mild facet arthropathy, and small disc bulge mildly narrows the central canal and right neural foramen.\\n\\nC7-T1: No significant central canal stenosis. The left neural foramen is mildly narrowed by uncovertebral and facet osteophytes.\\n\\nNo pathologic signal is detected in the cervical cord.\\n\\nImpression:\\n1. Apparent recent fracture/subluxation involving the left-sided articular processes at C3 and C4, with associated ligamentous sprain of the anterior longitudinal ligament and posterior paraspinal musculature at this level.\\n2. C2 fracture present by history is not well delineated by MRI, although subtle marrow changes in the right vertebral body of C2 could indicate the presence of underlying fracture.

Small disc protrusions are largest at the T4-T5, T6-T7, and T7-T8 levels, where the spinal canal is mildly narrowed. These are not well-characterized on axial imaging due to motion artifact. No more than mild neural foraminal narrowing is visible at any thoracic level.\\n\\nNo paraspinal soft tissue edema is identified.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.

CT abdomen and pelvis October 8, 2019.\\n\\nFindings: There is transitional anatomy with 4 purely lumbar type vertebra. The transitional thoracolumbar vertebra bearing diminutive ribs will be designated as L1.\\n\\nA subtle T1 and T2 hypointense, likely sclerotic lesion in the T11 left pedicle and vertebral body appears to correspond with focal uptake on prior bone scan, and subtle sclerosis on prior CT. No pathologic enhancement is associated with this lesion.\\n\\nHeterogenous sclerotic lesions are also present in the left iliac bone, the more anterior which is associated with central T2 hyperintensity and enhancement image 5 of series 8. Other small sclerotic lesions of the lumbar spine are nonspecific.\\n\\nSTIR hyperintensity and enhancement associated with the endplates at L2-L3 is favored represent Modic type I degenerative endplate change. Milder degenerative endplate changes are present elsewhere in the lumbar spine. No marrow edema is otherwise identified.\\n\\nNo pathologic enhancement is identified in the terminal cord or cauda equina.

This lesion again exhibits invasion versus displacement of the superior sagittal sinus with narrowing of the sinus lumen, as well as osseous extension into the right parietal bone. Minimal edema versus gliosis in the right parietal lobe at the interface with the mass is unchanged from prior study.\\n\\nThe diffusion weighted sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates solitary focus of hemosiderin deposition in the left cerebellar hemisphere. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. A few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter are nonspecific but compatible with mild microangiopathic changes. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The basilar flow-voids are intact.

Views: Routine multiecho and multiplanar images. FINDINGS: The mild degree of anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is stable and is related to bilateral L5 pars interarticularis defects. Vertebral body heights and signal from the osseous marrow elements are normal. Disc space heights are otherwise stable and normal. L1-2: No bulge or herniation or central stenosis. Mild facet hypertrophy without mass effect. Foraminal nerves are normal. L2-3: No bulge, herniation or central stenosis. Mild facet hypertrophy. Foraminal nerves are normal. L3-4: No bulge or herniation or central canal stenosis. Posterior elements are normal and foraminal nerves are normal. L4-5: There is a right-sided foraminal disc herniation of the extrusion type with 9.4 mm degree of cephalad migration of the extruded disc fragment into the midportion of the right foramina and adjacent to the undersurface of the exiting right L4 nerve in the foramina. There is stable facet hypertrophy causing moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis partially obscuring exiting left L4 nerve in the foramina. L5-S1 shows stable unroofing of the L5-S1 disc which shows generalized stable mild bulge however the bulge and the facet hypertrophy again causes bilateral severe foraminal stenosis greater on the right and possibly deforming the right exiting L5 nerve in the foramina and to a lesser extent on the left side. The thecal sac is developmentally small at this level. Visualized portions of the conus and cauda equina nerves are normal. Visualized paraspinal structures are normal.\\r\\n\""]}

MR enterography protocol performed\\n\\nCOMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recent MR enterography 1/9/2018\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nBowel: Chronic transmural low T2/fibrotic circumferential wall thickening of the entire terminal ileum with mild asymmetric dilatation of the short segment of small bowel leading up to this area of chronic stricturing (chronic mild partial small bowel obstruction), but no high-grade obstruction or significant change from priors. This terminal ileal segment shows mild circumferential enhancement. Terminal ileal single wall thickness measures up to about 8 mm, without obvious diffusion restriction. No surrounding inflammation. The remainder of the small and large bowel are unremarkable. No intra-abdominal abscess or obvious fistulization. Moderate to large volume right hemicolon stool burden without obstruction. Stomach and rectum show no obvious acute abnormality, although rectal evaluation is suboptimal due to rectal gas artifact.\\n\\nLiver: A couple tiny hepatic cysts are again seen.\\nBile Ducts: No significant abnormality.  No abnormal biliary dilatation.\\nGallbladder: Gallstones in the gallbladder without pericholecystic inflammation.\\nPancreas: A bilobed pancreatic uncinate cystic lesion measuring about 4 x 6 mm on series 4, image 45 in retrospect is likely not significantly changed dating back to October 2015.

Imaging performed before and after the intravenous and ministration of 17 mL ProHance\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nQuality: Motion degraded study with significant limitations.\\n\\nOsseous structures: The patient`s previously demonstrated pathologic dens fracture is redemonstrated with possible slight posterior migration of the odontoid fragment, now in near anatomic positioning relative to the prior CT. There is extensive pathologic marrow signal involving the C1 and C2 vertebra with inflammatory facet arthropathy at C2-3 bilaterally. There is an otherwise unchanged cervical alignment. Multilevel bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis. Postsurgical changes at C5-6 ACDF. Associated metallic separately artifact distorts assessment of adjacent tissues. Reactive marrow changes and diffusely hypointense T1 marrow signal in addition to the pathologic marrow signal described above.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: Extensive prevertebral edema extends from C2 through C5. Moderate edema with inhomogeneity of signal on the anterior longitudinal ligament at the injury though no discontinuity is apparent. There is abnormal effusions involving the C1-2 articulation and right C2-3 facet.\\n\\nCanal contents: Multilevel cord surface deformities attributable to spondylosis. Normal CSF spaces are effaced from C2 through C5 with some epidural venous plexus engorgement or fluid exacerbating CSF space effacement most pronounced at C2-3. Dural thickening and enhancement is present centered at the inflamed levels. No evidence of abnormal intrathecal enhancement.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  C2-3: CSF space effacement largely attributable to abnormal epidural fluid. No bony canal narrowing. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to left greater than right foraminal narrowing.\\n  C3-4: Osteophytic ridging and ligamentous hypertrophy effaces the normal CSF spaces and contribute to subtle cord flattening. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to marked bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  C4-5: Left central disc osteophyte complex abuts and deforms the ventral cord surface. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to right greater than left foraminal narrowing.\\n  C5-6: Post discectomy. Improved canal caliber. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to marked bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  C6-7: Left central disc osteophyte complex abuts and deforms the ventral cord surface. Degenerative facets and uncovertebral spurring contribute to left greater than right foraminal narrowing.\\n  C7-T1: No significant osteophytic ridging or canal stenosis. No significant foraminal stenosis.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.  On this motion degraded study, there is redemonstration of the pathologic type II dens fracture with interval reduction in the degree of anterior migration of the dominant fracture fragment. There is extensive marrow inflammation centered at C1-2 with extension into the C2-3 and C3-4 facets. There is epidural thickening or phlegmon most pronounced at the C2 level effacing normal CSF spaces.

No complications of suspected subacromioplasty or distal clavicle resection. Shoulder joint effusion/arthritis. Signer Name: Anton Allen Signed: 1/18/2021 4:57 PM EST Workstation Name: B7FF243\\r\\nMRI of the right shoulder, without contrast. Reason for exam: Right shoulder pain, chronic. Multiple injuries. TECHNIQUE: Non-IV contrast routine internal derangement shoulder protocol. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Multiple suture anchors indicating prior supraspinatus rotator cuff repair. Widened AC joint indicating likely prior distal clavicle resection. Gracile lateral acromion with flattened undersurface and associated susceptibility artifact suggests prior subacromioplasty. There is also suture anchor terminating in region of the bicipital groove also suggesting prior biceps tenodesis. Rotator cuff: Massive fully retracted full-thickness rotator cuff tear is seen involving the infraspinatus and most of the supraspinatus tendon. There is suggestion however of limited intact far anterior supraspinatus tendon tied down by suture anchors.  Pronounced supraspinatus muscle atrophy suspected although this is only partially imaged. Pronounced superior migration humeral head abutting the acromion. Long biceps tendon: Intact distal to level of biceps tenodesis. Not visualized proximal to this, compatible with prior resection. Glenohumeral joint: Joint effusion. No obvious loose bodies. Normal alignment humeral head in the glenoid. Subtle small tear of the posterior superior labrum. Arthritic subchondral cyst formation and osteophyte formation to some extend about the joint. Bones: No acute processes are seen. Soft tissues: No significant abnormalities.\\r\\n\""]}

There is a normal alignment. Vertebral body heights well-maintained. \\n\\nAt L1-2 there is increased STIR signal with adjacent vertebral body endplate cortical destruction and postcontrast enhancement with significant loss of intervertebral disc at this level, similar in appearance to slightly progressed since comparison CT from 12/10/2020. Adjacent enhancement and edema is present in the paraspinal soft tissues without discrete, drainable fluid collection. No epidural phlegmon is detected. Adjacent cortical erosions of the adjacent vertebral endplates also appear similar slightly progressed since comparison CT from 12/10/2020.\\n\\nRedemonstration of osseous erosions and inflammatory changes involving the right SI joint and right ischium with multiloculated enhancing fluid collection extending along the posterior aspect of the SI joint overall measuring approximately 4.3 x 2.0 cm.\\n\\nAreas of increased STIR signal and decreased T1 signal in the anterior superior endplates of L3 and L4 are less specific and potentially represent Modic type I degenerative changes, however given the presence of focal T2 hyperintense, enhancing material at the anterior superior corners of the endplates this is suspicious for underlying inflammatory arthropathy.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: Long posterior aspect of the right kidney is a 1.6 x 1.6 cm rim-enhancing fluid collection likely representing a renal abscess with mass effect on the posterior renal capsule. Intramuscular edema involves the adjacent right iliac is.\\n\\nCanal contents: The conus terminates at a normal level. The cauda equina is distributed as expected.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  L1-2: Osteophytic ridging and adjacent endplate erosive changes minimally narrow the central canal. Mild facet arthropathy. Moderate right and moderate/severe left foraminal narrowing.\\n  L2-3: Trace disc bulge mildly narrows the central canal. Moderate facet arthropathy. Mild right and mild/moderate left foraminal narrowing is present at this level.\\n  L3-4: No significant central canal stenosis or disc bulge. Facet arthropathy contribute to mild right and minimal left foraminal narrowing.\\n  L4-5: Trace disc bulge and osteophytic ridging without significant central canal stenosis. Facet arthropathy. Moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.\\n  L5-S1: Post surgical hardware with resultant artifact limits evaluation of the bilateral foramina, however there is no significant central canal stenosis.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\n1. Right sacroiliitis with adjacent inflammatory changes and apparent small abscess, as described above. This appears to extend into the anterior aspect of L5-S1 where there is a tiny rim enhancing fluid  collection favored to represent a small prevertebral abscess and findings suggesting probable developing osteomyelitis in this location.\\n2. Similar findings are present at L1-2 without adjacent abscess/fluid collection. This appears similar to comparison CT from 12/10/2020 and may represent advanced degenerative change, however given the other findings above, osteomyelitis/discitis at this level is also suspected.\\n3. Rim-enhancing fluid collection along the posterior aspect of the right kidney measuring 1.6 cm, nonspecific but potentially representing renal abscess given above findings. Surveillance is suggested to exclude neoplasm.\\n4. Multilevel lumbar spondylosis most advanced at L1-2, where osteophytic ridging and facet arthropathy contribute to moderate right and moderate/severe left foraminal narrowing.\\n5. Areas of marrow edema in the anterior superior endplates of L3 and L4 are associated with focal enhancement of the anterior superior corner of the vertebral body. These could represent underlying inflammatory arthropathy or early discitis. Surveillance is suggested.\\n\\n-- \\n \\n \\n  I have personally reviewed the image(s) and the resident interpretation and agree with the findings.\\n\\nPLATTEMP-33-50\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             01/13/2021 09:22\\nResident: Allred MD RES, Jonathan J\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

No previous reports are available. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence magnetic resonance images were obtained through the abdomen  without and with 6.5 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast. With diffusion weighted sequences. FINDINGS:   Liver: Normal in size and contour. No evidence for steatosis. No worrisome enhancement. No worrisome mass lesion. Hepatic artery is unremarkable. Hepatic and portal veins are unremarkable. Biliary Tree: Gallbladder is unremarkable with no stones, sludge, wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid. No intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. There is normal tapering of the common duct to the ampulla. Spleen: Normal size and signal. Pancreas: The small pancreatic mass is best demonstrated on CT scan from 10/8/2018. At that time it was hyperdense and measured 4.4 mm. A repeat CT scan has not been performed. On today`s study there does appear to be a focus of hyperenhancement once again and the pancreas, on MRI this measures 3 mm see image 12-35. It does correlate well with the previous CT finding. It is clearly not enlarging. No additional suspicious pancreatic findings demonstrated. No significant fatty atrophy. Normal parenchymal T1 hyperintensity with homogenous enhancement.  Pancreatic duct is nondilated. No peripancreatic inflammatory change. Adrenals: Unremarkable signal and morphology. Kidneys: Incompletely assessed due to field-of-view. Tiny subcentimeter cysts are present as well as some mild parapelvic cyst in the left renal hilum suspected. Other: Vasculature is unremarkable. There may be a minute amount of fluid adjacent to the spleen. Again very minimal if real No worrisome adenopathy. The patient has a history of Barrett`s dysplasia. MRI and CT are not ideal for this, no clear developing mass in this region. Sternotomy wires No worrisome osseous abnormality.\\r\\n\""]}

ET cervical spine June 12, 2016. Images from a prior MRI neck of February 9, 2006 are no longer available, however the report is available.\\n\\nFINDINGS: The diffusion sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. A punctate focus of elevated cortical signal on DWI in the parasagittal right frontal lobe image 17 series 3 is not associated with signal abnormality on other sequences and is favored artifactual. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.\\n\\nA few T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are present in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. These are nonspecific in morphology. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. There is no abnormal parenchymal enhancement following the administration of IV contrast. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear.\\n\\nThe pituitary gland exhibits a convex superior contour. This is favored related to the presence of a small bony sella rather than enlargement of the gland, as the craniocaudal dimension of 8 mm is within physiologic limits for age. No abnormal enhancement is identified in Meckel`s cave on either side or in the cisternal segments of the cranial nerves.\\n\\nIn the upper neck, an intrinsically T2 hyperintense lesion infiltrates the right parapharyngeal space and masticator space, interdigitating with visible portions of the right pterygoid musculature. On postcontrast imaging, this structure appears to demonstrate mild heterogenous enhancement.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No acute intracranial abnormality.\\n2. Several foci of T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter are nonspecific but abnormal in a patient of this age. These could represent manifestations of abnormally advanced for age microangiopathic change, however other processes such as chronic demyelination could also produce this appearance.\\n3. Incompletely visualized lesion in the upper neck centered on the right parapharyngeal space. This lesion is described on prior MRI neck of 2/16/2006, however the prior imaging is not available for comparison. This again could represent a venolymphatic malformation but is not specific as previously described. Dedicated neck imaging should be considered given the history of facial paresthesia if potentially attributable to this mass.\\n\\nPLATTEMP-33-50\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\n\\n\\nAuthenticated by: NOE MD, JACOB A                             01/12/2021 10:55\\n\\n\\n**FINAL REPORT**\\r\\n\""]}

Punctate foci of diffusion restriction as described.\\nBrain parenchyma: Moderate vasogenic edema adjacent to right parietal hemorrhagic lesion, unchanged from prior. Minimal white matter signal abnormality adjacent to right cerebellar and right frontal lobe lesions.\\nCSF spaces: Reflect volume loss.\\nMidline anatomy: No midline shift.\\nFlow-voids: The major central vascular flow voids are preserved\\nOther: None.\\n\\nCRANIAL/EXTRACRANIAL:\\nMarrow: No clear evidence for pathologic marrow signal.\\nParanasal sinuses and mastoid air cells: The imaged portions demonstrate minimal mucosal thickening and/or rentention cyst formation.\\nVisualized orbits: Unremarkable appearance on this limited assessment of the orbits.\\nOther: Noncontributory.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.

There is a relatively normal alignment. Bony remodeling compatible with spondylosis, most pronounced at L2-3.  No marrow signal edema to indicate acute injury. No findings to indicate significant marrow pathology.\\n\\nLigaments and soft tissues: Subtle paraspinous STIR signal intensity may indicate muscle spasm or strain on the right. Otherwise, no evidence of abnormal STIR signal to indicate acute ligamentous or soft tissue injury.  Mild nonspecific subcutaneous dorsal T2 signal changes, likely physiologic in a recumbent patient.

The cauda equina is distributed as expected.\\n\\nDisc levels: Multilevel degenerative loss of normal disc height and T2 disc signal.\\n  L1-2: No significant disc bulge, canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.\\n  L2-3: Mild disc bulge with ventral disc osteophyte complex. Minor foraminal narrowing. No canal stenosis.\\n  L3-4: Minor disc bulge with some osteophyte permission but minimal left and no right foraminal narrowing. No canal stenosis.\\n  L4-5: Shallow right foraminal to far lateral disc extrusion deforms the exiting right L4 nerve root. There is mild right and minimal left foraminal narrowing. No significant canal stenosis.\\n  L5-S1: Small right subarticular protrusion abuts and deforms the transiting right S1 nerve root. No canal stenosis. Minor degenerative facet changes contribute to subtle right greater than left foraminal narrowing.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.  Small disc herniations on the right at L4-5 and L5-S1 exert mass effect on the exiting right L4 nerve and transiting right S1 nerve root respectively.

No unusual artifacts beyond the limitations of routine MR.\\n\\nINTRACRANIAL:\\nHemorrhage: Trace nonacute blood products present within the left frontal lesion. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.\\nAcute infarct: No evidence of acute infarct. Diffusion restriction present within the enhancing left frontal tumor. \\nBrain parenchyma: 1.7 x 2.0 cm cystic or necrotic mass with rightward thick irregular enhancement and diminished diffusivity showing extensive left frontoparietal vasogenic edema with sulcal effacement and ventricular deformity. There is a 3-4 millimeters of left-to-right midline shift. No new foci of abnormal intracranial enhancement. The right occipital enhancing focus is not well seen on today`s study. Minor nonspecific periventricular white matter T2 signal intensities are similar to the prior study.\\nCSF spaces: No evidence of obstruction.\\nMidline anatomy: 3 to 4 mm of left-to-right midline shift. Otherwise, as expected.\\nFlow-voids: The major central vascular flow voids are preserved\\nOther: None.\\n\\nCRANIAL/EXTRACRANIAL:\\nMarrow: No clear evidence for pathologic marrow signal.\\nParanasal sinuses and mastoid air cells: Patchy bilateral mastoid effusions.\\nVisualized orbits: Unremarkable appearance on this limited assessment of the orbits.\\nOther: Cervical spondylosis.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Interval enlargement of the left frontal lesion which is now medially necrotic and peripherally thickened and irregular and shows marked associated surrounding vasogenic edema.

Vermillion MD Signed: 1/21/2021 11:37 AM EST Workstation Name: J8Q99N2\\r\\nMRI abdomen with and without IV contrast MRI pelvis with without IV contrast HISTORY: Multiple splenic nodules. Cholecystectomy. Tubal ligation. TECHNIQUE: T1 and T2-weighted imaging through the abdomen and pelvis with and without IV contrast. FINDINGS: ABDOMEN: Spleen has dimensions of 11.7 x 5.3 x 11.2 cm. Innumerable ill-defined T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense nodules throughout the spleen, which vary in size from a few millimeters up to 15 mm. Postcontrast sequence demonstrates tiny 2 to 3 mm hypointense nodules throughout the spleen and 15 mm dominant lesion with peripheral enhancement: During the early and late venous phases, nodules demonstrate homogeneous internal enhancement, including the dominant 15 mm lesion. Radiographic findings are nonspecific. The primary considerations include, but are not limited to, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, metastases particularly in the setting of melanoma, granulomatous and fungal infectious processes. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Liver has an estimated length of 17 cm. No discrete hepatic mass. Gallbladder is not visualized. No biliary dilatation. Pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys within normal limits. No enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. No ascites. No evidence of inflamed viscus or mechanical bowel obstruction. Multiple nonspecific T2 hyperintense lesions within the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies characterized by hypointense T1 signal, hyperintense T2 signal, with no definitive enhancement. Note: Vertebral levels are difficult to determine with certainty: Estimated 13 mm hyperintense lesion lower thoracic spine, probably T9 level. Similar-appearing small T2 hyperintense lesion lower thoracic spine, probably T12 level. Lobulated hyperintense lesions within the lower lumbar spine, probably L3 and L4 levels, measuring upwards of 2.2 cm. Etiology/significance not determined. Considerations include, but are not limited to, atypical hemangiomas, metastases, and atypical foci of red marrow hyperplasia. Nuclear medicine bone scan and/or plain films recommended. Lung bases: Cardiomegaly. Small pericardial effusion. Pelvis: Mild circumferential bladder wall thickening. No visible discrete bladder mass or polyp. Uterus demonstrates normal size and contour: Estimated 11 mm suspected benign myometrial fibroid dorsal uterine fundus, sagittal image 12, series 4, coronal image 17, series 3. Nonspecific hyperintense lesions within the distal sacrum and S2 vertebral body, sagittal T2-weighted sequence image 29, series 5. Nonspecific 2.5 cm round hyperintense lesion within the left upper acetabulum, sagittal image 13, series 5. Advanced degenerative disc disease L5-S1 with anterolisthesis, concentric disc bulge, facet arthrosis, and bilateral bony foraminal encroachment. No enlarged lymph nodes. No ascites.\\r\\n\""]}

No significant canal or foraminal narrowing in the cervical cervical spine. Focal lumbar spondylosis at L4-5. This results in mild canal and up to mild/moderate foraminal narrowing. This is similar in appearance to the prior exam.\\n2.  Mildly T1 hypointense marrow signal is a nonspecific finding most often attributable to iron deficiency anemia in this gender and age group. Correlation with CBC may be helpful.\\n3.  On a single sequence there appears to be some asymmetric degenerative changes of the SI joints.

There is a defect within the subcutaneous tissues adjacent to this. Abnormal signal is seen within the cortex with irregularity of the cortex of the calcaneus. There is T1 hypointensity, T2 hyperintensity, and postcontrast enhancement of the calcaneus in this area involving a total transaxial area of approximately 2.4 x 1.7 cm with a craniocaudad extent of approximately 1.9 cm. This is concerning for osteomyelitis involving approximately 1.7 cm along the cortical surface of the Achilles tendon attachment site. The remaining image flexor and extensor tendons appear to be intact. The plantar fascia is intact. Increased signal is seen within the musculature of the foot with associated fatty atrophy which could suggest denervation atrophy. Decreased signal seen within the calcaneal fat pad involving area measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 2.3 cm. Partially imaged within the soft tissues of the foot musculature there is a 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm hypointense possibly calcified or hemosiderin staining lesion which may abut or arise from the third flexor digitorum longus tendon. This is nonspecific but could suggest a synovial giant cell. This occurs at the level of the mid third metatarsal diaphysis. Impression Suspect osteomyelitis of the calcaneus with tear or laceration of the adjacent Achilles tendon attachment along the posterior lateral calcaneal margin. Nonspecific lesion seen within the foot musculature along the plantar surface which may contain hemosiderin or calcification. This abuts the flexor digitorum longus tendon to the third toe. Imaging features may suggest a giant cell tumor of tendon sheath. Fibroma of the tendon sheath, which arthritis nodule, or desmoid tumor are different considerations.

Patient underwent biopsy recently with placement of a localization clip along the anterior portion of right breast architectural distortion.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:Bilateral breast MR 3T imaging was performed with a dedicated 8 channel Aegis breast coil.  Patient was  placed prone with the breast  immobilized with light compression. Following localization sequence used: T2 SPAIR axial fat-suppressed, T1 Axial non fat suppressed 3-D, T1 3-D fat-suppressed precontrast followed by serial T1 axial 3-D fat-suppressed post-dynamic imaging. Contrast delay of 20 seconds. Dynamic sequences were post processed to optimize radiologist interpretation by generating 3D reconstructions, subtraction images and multiplanar reformats from the dynamic contrast data at a separate Aegis workstation. Patient received 0.1Mm/kg Multihance IV 13 cc.\\n\\nMR FINDINGS:\\nRIGHT BREAST:Amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT): Heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue\\nBackground parenchymal enhancement (BPE):Mild\\n\\nIn the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, there is regional nonmass enhancement which extends to adjacent skin surface involving the RIGHT lateral breast. There is focal diffuse thickening with enhancement involving the skin overlying the nonmass-like enhancement and mass with mild retraction. No involvement of the nipple areolar complex Within the area of nonmass enhancement, there are multiple well-circumscribed masses of increased T2 signal. Overall area of nonmass-like enhancement spans 4.5 x 5 cm.\\n\\nA hydrated hydromark clip is present along the subcutaneous fat anterior margin of the enhancing mass.\\nNo right axillary adenopathy. There is a right internal mammary nodes (series 7 image 129). \\n\\nLEFT BREAST: Amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT):  Heterogenous fibroglandular tissue\\nBackground parenchymal enhancement (BPE): Mild\\n \\nNo suspicious area of mass or nonmass enhancement is identified. Nipple areolar complex enhances normally.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\nRegional nonmass-like enhancement involving the RIGHT breast upper outer quadrant is similar distribution to current mammogram. This represents extensive multifocal involvement spanning the 9-12 position. Overlying skin thickening and enhancement with retraction suspicious for direct invasion.\\nNo involvement of the underlying nipple.\\nNo abnormal appearing axillary lymph nodes.\\n\\nAbnormal RIGHT internal mammary lymph node\\n\\nBenign LEFT breast MR\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: Surgical oncology referral/management with Dr. James McLoughlin has been established through the UT breast care service.

No evidence of acute infarct. 2. Multiple chronic infarcts and moderate microangiopathic changes. 3. Abnormal flow void of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus is nonspecific but favored secondary to slow flow as described above. A contrast-enhanced CT performed in the venous phase is suggested to most effectively confirm slow flow and exclude the possibility of venous sinus thrombosis. Signer Name: Jacob A Noe MD Signed: 1/8/2021 2:58 PM EST Workstation Name: 5DM6SZ2\\r\\nHISTORY: Stroke, follow-up neuro deficit, acute. Left-sided weakness. Increasing behavioral outbursts.. Technique: MRI of the brain without contrast. COMPARISON: CT head January 4, 2021. FINDINGS: The diffusion sequence demonstrates no acute infarct. The gradient echo sequence demonstrates no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. A chronic focal infarct involves the right basal ganglia. Chronic lacunar infarct is also visible in the right thalamus. The chronic infarct in the right occipital lobe is also noted, with cystic encephalomalacia communicating with the lateral ventricle. T2/FLAIR hyperintensities elsewhere throughout the periventricular and subcortical white matter are nonspecific but compatible with mild microangiopathic changes. With global parenchymal atrophy is moderate. There is no hydrocephalus or extra-axial collection. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear. The right transverse sinus flow void is attenuated on the T2 and FLAIR images but does not demonstrate signal dropout on GRE sequence or intrinsic T1 signal abnormality.\\r\\n\""]}

Included distal spinal cord signal is normal. Vertebral body heights and alignment are normal. Bone marrow signal is maintained throughout. Desiccation of the intervertebral discs is mild, primarily at the T10-T11, T11-T12, L1-L2, L3-L4, and L5-S1 levels. Each level will be further discussed in detail below. Disc space heights are relatively well-maintained with mild loss of disc space height at the L1-L2 and L5-S1 levels primarily appreciated. The included sacrum and SI joints are intact and otherwise unremarkable. The paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. T10-T11: No central canal or foraminal stenosis T11-T12: No central canal or foraminal stenosis T12-L1: No central canal or foraminal stenosis L1-L2: Minimal flattening of the anterior thecal sac contour is demonstrated with a very mild circumferential disc bulge noted. Central canal and neural foramen are widely patent. L2-L3: Very mild primarily anterior extending circumferential disc bulge. Mild bilateral degenerative facet joint hypertrophy and very mild hypertrophy ligamentum flavum noted. Central canal neural foramen are widely patent. L3-L4: Mild circumferential disc bulge is noted. Mild hypertrophic facet joint degenerative change and mild hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum is appreciated. Central canal and neural foramen are widely patent. L4-L5: Mild circumferential disc bulge is noted. Severe hypertrophic facet joint degenerative change on the right is appreciated, mild on the left. Hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum is noted. Mild circumferential narrowing of the central canal is appreciated. Mild right greater than left foraminal stenosis is also appreciated without evidence of L4 nerve root compromise. L5-S1: Moderate to large marginal osteophytes laterally on the right are appreciated. Circumferential disc bulge, covering these osteophytes is noted. There is a foraminal disc protrusion on the right with small extrusion also noted on the left. Degenerative facet joint hypertrophy is mild. There is no significant central canal stenosis. However disc osteophyte complex contributes to mild to moderate foraminal stenosis on the right and moderate on the left. Circumferential perineural fat is maintained bilaterally without evidence of foraminal nerve root compromise. IMPRESSION: Overall mild degenerative changes, as detailed above. No evidence of more than mild central canal stenosis, most prominent at the L4-L5 level. Mild to moderate left greater than right L5-S1 foraminal stenosis without MRI evidence of L5 nerve root compromise. No significant central canal stenosis or MRI evidence of foraminal nerve root compromise elsewhere.
