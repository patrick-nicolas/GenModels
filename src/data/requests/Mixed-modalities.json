Ultrasound of the right breast focal to the areas of previous concern. Comparison January 20 2020, July 17 2019, January 16 2019, July 10 2018 Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. The well-circumscribed hypoechoic lesion seen 1 cm from the nipple at the 11:00 position appears to be stable for greater than 2 years and is likely benign.  At the 3 o`clock position there is a 2 x 3 x 3 mm possibly septated cyst which has been stable for 18 months.  This is 3 cm from the nipple.  There is a stable 3 x 3 x 2 mm fibrocystic nodule 3 cm from the nipple at the 3 o`clock position.  At the 9:00 position there is a stable complicated septated cystic lesion unchanged for greater than 2 years which is 9 x 7 x 3 mm located 2 cm from the nipple.  No concerning interval changes seen. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Probably benign complicated cysts again seen within the right breast.  No significant change in the appearance of the mammogram.  Follow-up ultrasound is recommended in 6 months to evaluate the cystic areas that have been stable for 18 months.

Comparison August 22 2011 Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Recommend routine breast self-examination for breast self awareness Should you developed a lump or any change in your breast before your next breast imaging appointment, contact your physician or other healthcare provider for an exam without delay.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

HASTE IMAGES WERE OBTAINED IN THE  AXIAL, SAGITTAL AND CORONAL PLANES.  HIGH RESOLUTION 3-D T2 WEIGHTED  IMAGES WERE THEN OBTAINED.  NEXT, AXIAL STIR, DIFFUSION WEIGHTED AND T1  WEIGHTED IN- AND OUT-OF-PHASE IMAGES WERE OBTAINED.  THEN, USING A 3-D  GRE T1 WEIGHTED SEQUENCE, DYNAMIC IMAGES WERE OBTAINED BEFORE, DURING AND  AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.    3-D IMAGES WERE POST-PROCESSED ON A DEDICATED OFF-LINE WORKSTATION AND  WERE REVIEWED BY THE INTERPRETING PHYSICIAN.    CONTRAST:  IV:  13 ML OF DOTAREM  ORAL CONTRAST: NONE    RESULT:    PANCREAS: PERIPANCREATIC STRANDING. THERE IS A 1.9 X 2.3 X 2.3 CM CYSTIC  LESION IN THE PANCREATIC HEAD (5:40).  LAYERING/DEPENDENT DEBRIS APPEARS  PRESENT.  THE VISUALIZED PORTIONS OF THE PANCREATIC DUCT ARE NORMAL.    BILIARY: THERE IS NO INTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DILATION.  THE COMMON BILE DUCT  IS NORMAL IN COURSE AND CALIBER.  NO FILLING DEFECTS ARE IDENTIFIED  WITHIN THE COMMON BILE DUCT.  THE GALLBLADDER IS NORMAL IN APPEARANCE.    LIVER: COUPLE T2 HYPERINTENSE NONENHANCING CYSTIC STRUCTURES ARE  SCATTERED IN THE LIVER, THE LARGEST IN THE INFERIOR RIGHT HEPATIC LOBE  MEASURING UP TO 1.2 CM.  NO ENHANCING HEPATIC MASS IS IDENTIFIED.  THERE  IS NO THROMBUS IN THE PORTAL VENOUS SYSTEM (SPLENIC VEIN, MAIN PORTAL  VEIN, LEFT AND RIGHT ANTERIOR AND RIGHT POSTERIOR PORTAL VEIN BRANCHES).    KIDNEYS: THE VISUALIZED PORTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS ENHANCE SYMMETRICALLY.  THERE IS NO HYDROURETERONEPHROSIS.    THERE IS NO FOCAL ENHANCING RENAL  LESION.    OTHER ABDOMINAL FINDINGS: THE SPLEEN IS NORMAL IN SIZE.    THERE ARE NO  FOCAL SPLENIC MASSES. THE ADRENALS ARE NORMAL. THERE IS NO  LYMPHADENOPATHY. THERE IS NO ASCITES.  SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS  WITH BILATERAL LOWER LOBE ATELECTASIS/CONSOLIDATION.    IMPRESSION:    PERIPANCREATIC STRANDING COMPATIBLE WITH PANCREATITIS WITH A 2.3 CM  CYSTIC LESION AT THE LEVEL OF THE PANCREATIC HEAD MOST SUGGESTIVE OF A  PSEUDOCYST.    HEPATIC CYSTS.
