Comparison February 3 2020, January 20 2019, January 25 2018, January 19 2017, January, 2016, December 29 2014, November 6 2013 Findings A new asymmetry is seen within the central middle depth right breast measuring approximately 1 x 9 mm on the CC view.  This is not definitely seen on the MLO view but an area of interest is marked.  No architectural distortion, concerning microcalcification, or other masslike area is otherwise seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Right breast asymmetry.

Ultrasound of the right breast focal to the areas of previous concern. Comparison January 20 2020, July 17 2019, January 16 2019, July 10 2018 Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. The well-circumscribed hypoechoic lesion seen 1 cm from the nipple at the 11:00 position appears to be stable for greater than 2 years and is likely benign.  At the 3 o`clock position there is a 2 x 3 x 3 mm possibly septated cyst which has been stable for 18 months.  This is 3 cm from the nipple.  There is a stable 3 x 3 x 2 mm fibrocystic nodule 3 cm from the nipple at the 3 o`clock position.  At the 9:00 position there is a stable complicated septated cystic lesion unchanged for greater than 2 years which is 9 x 7 x 3 mm located 2 cm from the nipple.  No concerning interval changes seen. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Probably benign complicated cysts again seen within the right breast.  No significant change in the appearance of the mammogram.  Follow-up ultrasound is recommended in 6 months to evaluate the cystic areas that have been stable for 18 months.

Postsurgical changes are again seen within the left breast without concerning interval change. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Stable postsurgical changes with mild reduction in the scarring seen at the site of surgical resection.  Recommend follow-up imaging in 6 months.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Comparison May 22 2017 Findings A group of calcifications is suspected within the central mid right breast. Asymmetry is suspected within the central mid left breast.  A 2nd asymmetry is suspected within the posterolateral superior left breast. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Right breast calcifications.  Recommend further characterization with magnification and lateral views. Left breast asymmetries.  Recommend spot compression imaging and p.r.n. ultrasound for further characterization.

The patient returned on February 22, 2021 for diagnostic evaluation of the left breast.  With spot compression the area of asymmetry compresses similar to the surrounding breast tissue without an underlying mass, although the area of concern diffusely increases in density compared to the recent screening exam.  No suspicious calcifications or masses. Ultrasound evaluation is therefore needed and is performed subsequently same day. Targeted ultrasound evaluation subareolar left breast shows moderate ductal ectasia without suspicious filling defects, or evidence of a mass otherwise sonographically.

The patient returned on February 22, 2021 for diagnostic evaluation of the right breast.  The subtle right nipple retraction is unchanged since at least 2014 and also unchanged from an older available exam from October 9, 2009, typical of a benign and/or otherwise physiologic finding.  With spot compression, the area of asymmetry at the nipple line central right breast on CC view and MLO view resolves, suggestive of overlapping breast tissue..

Patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Formal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure to verify patient, site, and procedure. \\n\\nOverlying skin of the left breast was aseptically prepared and sterile towels were placed. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were employed. The skin and deeper soft tissues were locally anesthetized with 2 cc 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate. Deeper soft tissues were anesthetized with xylocaine with Epinephrine.. \\nA small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a vacuum-assisted mammotome 13-gauge biopsy device and 3-4 core biopsy specimens were obtained. \\nThese were considered  adequate. \\n\\nA Hydromark  T3 localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy.. \\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy left CC and ML digital mammogram demonstrates the clip to be in appropriate position. .\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the Breast Center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions. Patient was discharged with ice pack and compression wrap to minimize risk of post biopsy hematoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1.

The patient returned on February 22, 2021 for diagnostic evaluation of the left breast.  With spot compression, well-circumscribed 4 mm asymmetry in the lateral right breast, approximately 2.5-3 cm from the nipple persists.  The area of asymmetry in the lateral left breast, approximately 5 cm from the nipple compresses similar to the surrounding breast tissue.  The more anterior, circumscribed asymmetry is probably benign.  This may correspond to an otherwise unchanged subareolar asymmetry which projects approximately 2 cm directly posterior to the nipple on the left MLO view.  No MLO view correlate for the area of asymmetry in the more posterior, lateral left breast..  No suspicious calcifications or masses. Typically benign calcifications again noted. Ultrasound evaluation of the lateral left breast shows localized area of increased density at the 3 o`clock position of the left breast, approximately 7 cm from the nipple but no sonographic correlate for the areas of mammographic concern.  These are probably benign of which simply six-month follow-up is recommended..\\r\\n\""]}

On going for several years , with a negative cardiac workup for similar symptoms in 2018.  On the left, this begins around the mid axillary line and radiates to the periareolar region.  On the right, this is primarily along the lateral periareolar region.  Both resolve with lifting of the breasts.  No 1st degree relatives with a history of breast cancer, although there is a family member who is a breast cancer survivor, now age 38 years.

No suspicious calcifications or masses. There are no suspicious findings to suggest malignancy when compared with prior exams. Targeted ultrasound evaluation of both breasts, at the area of patient pain shows normal breast tissue without abnormalities sonographically.  There is a normal intramammary lymph node at the 3 o`clock position of the left breast. Physical exam evaluation of both breasts reveals no suspicious palpable lumps.

COMPARISON 2016, 2018, 2020 TISSUE DENSITY DENSITYCODE:  B Scattered fibroglandular densities (25-50%) FINDINGS Standard CC, MLO, and true lateral views of the left breast were performed.  The previously placed clip in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast is no longer evident.  No suspicious masses, areas of concerning architectural distortion, or suspiciously clustered microcalcifications are identified. Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT No concerning interval mammographic changes in left breast.  The clip is no longer evident. Recommendation: Routine annual screening mammography in August 2021.

Postprocedural right CC and ML mammogram with tomographic imaging for clip localization.\\n\\nREASON: Suspicious mass right breast 2:00-3:00/central to nipple posterior depth.\\n\\nHISTORY: 41-year-old female with abnormal high risk screening breast MRI 2/2/2021 demonstrating suspicious enhancing mass right breast 2:00-3:00/central to nipple posterior depth, possible fibroadenoma, along with suspicious enhancement in the upper outer quadrant left breast. Patient underwent further diagnostic evaluation with targeted ultrasound was sonographic correlate in the right breast felt to correspond with MR findings. No definite findings to correspond with enhancement in the left breast. Patient was originally scheduled for same day left breast MRI guided biopsy to be followed by right breast ultrasound-guided core biopsy, however due to inclement weather and issues in the MRI department/scanner, MR biopsy had to be rescheduled. \\n\\nPROCEDURE: Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of suspicious mass right breast 2:00-3:00 central to nipple posterior depth. \\n\\nOPERATORS: Dr Rashad Daker\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:\\nWritten and verbal informed consent  was obtained which includes (but is not limited to) risk of bleeding, pain, and nondiagnostic biopsy. Potential need for repeat biopsy and/or surgical referral also discussed with the patient. Patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Formal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure to verify patient, site, and procedure.\\n\\nPreprocedural ultrasound again demonstrates hypoechoic mass right breast 2:00-3:00/central to nipple posterior depth along the chest wall, felt to most likely correspond with enhancing mass noted on breast MR. Furthermore just inferior to the targeted mass is a anechoic lobulated cluster of cysts corresponding with findings on MR with similar anatomic relationship.\\n\\nOverlying skin of the right breast was aseptically prepared and sterile towels were placed. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were employed and maintained throughout the procedure. The skin and deeper soft tissues were locally anesthetized with 2-3 cc 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 14 gauge automatic Inrad core biopsy needle without introducer was placed  and a total of 5 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate. \\n\\nHydromark HM4 (butterfly)  localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy. \\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy right CC and ML digital mammogram with tomographic imaging demonstrates the clip in expected position right breast 2:00-3:00/central to nipple posterior depth in expected position given location of targeted mass on MR.\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the Breast Center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions. Patient was discharged with ice pack to minimize risk of post biopsy hematoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 4, suspicious.\\n1.  Technically successful ultrasound guided core biopsy of suspicious mass right breast 2:00-3:00/central to nipple posterior depth. Hydromark HM4 (butterfly) tissue marker is felt to be in appropriate position. \\n2.

History of left breast cancer status post mastectomy in 1990. COMPARISON: Ultrasound and mammogram exams March 20, 2019 and April 8, 2019, respectively, January 8, 2018, and December 7, 2016 FINDINGS: The breast parenchymal pattern is primarily heterogeneously dense, which can obscure small masses.  No suspicious calcifications or masses. There are no suspicious findings to suggest malignancy when compared with prior exams. Complete right breast ultrasound, including the nipple areolar complex and right axilla is performed.  The benign simple cyst at the 12 o`clock position of the right breast approximately 3 cm and 1 cm from the nipple measuring up to 5 mm maximally are again noted.  Mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla measuring up to 12 mm short axis again with a prominent fatty hilum and thin cortex, typically benign and stable to slightly smaller when compared with prior imaging in 2019 are also again noted.  Of note, these have not significantly changed from prior CT of the chest January 10, 2017, either.  There are no suspicious findings to suggest malignancy when compared with prior exams..\\r\\n\""]}

Positive family history of breast cancer in the patient`s sister and mother. COMPARISON 2012-2014, 2016-2020 TISSUE DENSITY DENSITYCODE:  B Scattered fibroglandular densities (25-50%) FINDINGS Bilateral standard cc and MLO views were performed.  A true lateral view of the left breast and focused left axillary ultrasound was also performed. No suspicious masses, areas of concerning architectural distortion, or suspiciously clustered microcalcifications are identified.  A mildly prominent lymph node in the left axillary region is present but this appears similar to the 2018 exam.  Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Focused left axillary ultrasound was performed.  This demonstrated a few mildly prominent lymph nodes in the left axillary region with the largest measuring approximately 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm.  These lymph nodes maintain a normal fatty hila and do not demonstrate cortical thickening.  No other sonographic abnormalities noted. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT No suspicious interval mammographic changes in either breast to suggest malignancy.  A few mildly prominent but otherwise normal appearing lymph nodes are noted in the left axillary region and are favored to be reactive in nature. Recommendation: Appropriate clinical management/follow-up of the patient`s reported palpable abnormality.  Additionally, the patient should return in approximately 4-6 weeks for a left axillary ultrasound to reassess the mildly prominent nodes.

This is associated with an approximately 40-year-old surgical scar. Patient has noted changes in the appearance of scar over the past several months.\\n\\nOPERATORS: Dr. Garnetta Morin-Ducote\\n\\nPROCEDURE: Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy  of LEFT breast upper outer quadrant 2:00 position architectural distortion. Site A will represent the superficial anterior mass directly below the scar and site B will represent the deeper posterior asymmetry. . Following written and verbal consent including a discussion of the possible complications of this procedure including pain, bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, and a low risk of a punctured lung given proximity to the chest wall. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Patient agrees to proceed. The patient was placed in the supine position. \\nTimeout procedure was followed to check patient`s name, birthdate and site of procedure.\\nPatient`s sample container(s) were labeled with a pre-printed label containing the patient`s name, today`s date and medical record number . Laterality and site was also written on the container prior to the procedure. \\nOverlying skin of the LEFT breast was aseptically prepared with ChloraPrep solution.\\nThe LEFT breast was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.\\nFormal final timeout was performed to verify the patient, correct site, and correct procedure. \\nThe LEFT breast was confirmed and marked with R or L for laterality. \\nAll elements of maximal sterile barrier technique was followed.\\n\\nSITE A: Using aseptic technique the skin locally anesthetized with 3 cc 2% lidocaine solution. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 16 gauge automatic Bard core biopsy needle with introducer was placed and 4 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate.\\nCLIP PLACEMENT: Hydro mark Shape 3 mini localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy.\\n\\nSITE B: Using aseptic technique the skin locally anesthetized with 3 cc 2% lidocaine solution. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 14 gauge automatic Bard core biopsy needle with introducer was placed and 4 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate.\\n\\nCLIP PLACEMENT: Hydro mark Shape 4 localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy.\\n\\nAntibiotic ointment was applied to the biopsy site. A small Band-Aid was placed over the biopsy site. No complications to the procedure. No significant bleeding at the entrance site. \\n\\nThe specimen container was then shown to the patient who confirmed labeling and name as accurate.

Focused left breast ultrasound also performed. The previously detailed small asymmetry persist in the lateral aspect of the slightly superior left breast on today`s additional mammographic images.  Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Focused left breast ultrasound was performed.  This demonstrated a small hypoechoic nodule measuring 4 x 2 x 2 mm in the upper outer quadrant near the 2 o`clock position 6 cm from the nipple.  This small nodule may represent a small lymph node, but appears too small to correspond to the mammographic abnormality.  No other sonographic abnormalities noted. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Small left breast asymmetry and nodule as detailed above which are favored to be benign in etiology.

In addition, potential risk for worsening chemical mastitis discussed with the patient. Potential need for repeat biopsy and/or surgical referral also discussed with the patient. Patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Formal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure to verify patient, site, and procedure. \\n\\nOverlying skin of the left breast was aseptically prepared and sterile towels were placed. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were employed and maintained throughout the procedure. The skin and deeper soft tissues were locally anesthetized with 2-3 cc 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 16 gauge automatic Bard core biopsy needle without introducer was placed  and a total of 6 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate. Smaller gauge biopsy device utilized to try to mitigate risk of potential worsening chemical mastitis.\\n\\nHydromark HM3 mini  localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy. \\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy left CC and ML digital mammogram demonstrates the clip in appropriate position, centered within the focal asymmetry mammographically.\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the Breast Center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions. Patient was discharged with ice pack to minimize risk of post biopsy hematoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 4, suspicious.\\n1.  Technically successful ultrasound guided core biopsy of suspicious palpable mass/focal asymmetry left breast 12:00-1:00 anterior depth.

Focused bilateral breast ultrasound also performed. The previously detailed bilateral breast asymmetries faintly persists on today`s additional mammographic images and appear low density and partially obscured.  Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Focused bilateral breast ultrasound was performed.  In the retroareolar right breast, there are subcentimeter simple appearing cyst. In the lower outer quadrant of the left breast near the 3 o`clock position there is mildly complex cystic change measuring approximately 0.6 x 0.7 x 1 cm.  An additional minimally complex cyst is noted in the lower inner quadrant near the 7 o`clock position measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 1.3 cm.  A simple appearing cyst is also noted in the lower inner quadrant. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Left breast asymmetries and complex cystic change, favored to be benign in etiology.  The right breast asymmetries appear to correspond to benign simple cyst.

Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased.

Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Potential need for repeat biopsy and/or surgical referral also discussed with the patient. Patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Formal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure to verify patient, site, and procedure. \\n\\nOverlying skin of the left breast was aseptically prepared and sterile towels were placed. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were employed and maintained throughout the procedure. The skin and deeper soft tissues were locally anesthetized with 4-5 cc 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 14 gauge automatic Inrad core biopsy needle without introducer was placed  and a total of 5 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate. \\n\\nHydromark HM1 (closed coil)  localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy. \\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy left CC and ML digital mammogram with tomographic imaging demonstrates the clip in appropriate position along the posterior/deep aspect of the targeted mass left breast o`clock posterior depth.\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the Breast Center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions. Patient was discharged with ice pack to minimize risk of post biopsy hematoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 5, highly suggestive of malignancy.\\n1.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Diagnostic targeted right breast ultrasound CLINICAL INFORMATION: 67 y/o  F presenting for further evaluation of right breast asymmetry. COMPARISON: February 1, 2021, 2019-2015 TECHNIQUE: 1. Diagnostic digital mammogram, standard and spot compression views with CAD 2. Diagnostic targeted right breast ultrasound performed in a real-time by the sonographer under the direction of the radiologist. FINDINGS: DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM: Mammographic pattern is scattered fibroglandular densities.  Previously described asymmetry in the lateral right breast does not definitively persist on spot compression views.  Localization clip in the lateral right breast again noted.  Scattered typically benign calcifications appear unchanged.  No mass, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications identified. Please see additional sonographic findings further detailed below. BREAST ULTRASOUND: Targeted ultrasound of the lateral right breast was performed.  Island of fibroglandular tissue visualized at the 2 o`clock position approximately 7 cm from the nipple.  No suspicious mass, fluid collection or parenchymal distortion.  No suspicious sonographic findings.\\r\\n\""]}

In the posterior aspect of the lower inner quadrant of the left breast there is a grouping of heterogeneous microcalcifications which cover an area of approximately 1.4 x 0.5 cm. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings.

No suspicious calcifications or right breast masses.  Most of the subareolar asymmetry left CC view has been present since at least 2007 typical of benign/physiologic findings.

Written and verbal consent were obtained after discussing the risks, benefits, alternatives and potential and most likely complications which include (but not limited to) risk of bleeding, pain, and nondiagnostic biopsy. The potential need for repeat biopsy and/or surgical referral also discussed with the patient. All patient questions were answered, the patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy.\\n\\nFormal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure patient verification confirming 2 identifiers, site, and procedure. The right breast was marked.\\n\\nThe 9 mm mass at the 4 to 5:00 position 3 cm from the nipple in the right breast was targeted with ultrasound. The overlying skin was then marked and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine was utilized for local anesthetic. A tiny skin nick was made to allow for introduction of the biopsy needle. A 14-gauge Marquee core biopsy needle was then advanced into the mass under continuous real-time sonographic guidance. Core sampling was then obtained. A metallic HydroMARK open coil shape 3 tissue marker was deployed within the biopsy cavity under ultrasound guidance.\\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed. The samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOSTPROCEDURE MAMMOGRAM: Postbiopsy CC and ML mammographic views of the right breast were obtained (PPM). There are postprocedure changes, clip position correlates with mammographic mass.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nNo immediate complications.  \\nHemostasis was easily achieved. Estimated blood loss was scant and insignificant. \\nA post procedure digital mammogram was obtained. \\nClip position: Concordant.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\nRight breast ultrasound-guided biopsy:\\n- Suspicious 9 mm mass, 4-5 o`clock 3 cm from the nipple.\\n\\nThe patient was was given wound care instructions (including review of signs of latent complications) and was discharged from the Breast Center in stable condition without any immediate complications.

Focused left breast ultrasound also performed.  Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. The previously detailed asymmetry faintly persists on today`s additional spot compression cc view and the true lateral view although it is not definitively identified on the implant displaced Roux lateral view. Focused left breast ultrasound was performed.  This demonstrated no concerning sonographic abnormalities in the retroareolar, lower outer, or lower inner quadrants. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Faint left breast asymmetry which is favored to be benign in etiology as no corresponding sonographic abnormalities were identified. Recommendation: The patient should return in 6 months for diagnostic left mammogram to reassess.

With spot compression the area of asymmetry persist and becomes partially obscured.  Ultrasound evaluation is therefore indicated and is performed subsequently same day. Targeted ultrasound evaluation of the medial left breast shows dense and heterogenous breast tissue but no suspicious abnormality sonographically otherwise.  No mammographic correlate.

No suspicious masses, areas of concerning architectural distortion, or suspiciously clustered microcalcifications are identified.  Stable left breast asymmetry in the upper inner quadrant near the 12 o`clock position, containing a clip mammographically.  Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Focused left breast ultrasound was performed.

Prior palpable nodule in the right breast approximately 2 months ago which the patient states is no longer definitively present. COMPARISON 2014, 2015 TISSUE DENSITY DENSITYCODE:  C heterogeneously dense (51-75%) FINDINGS Bilateral cc and MLO tomosynthesis images with reconstruction were performed.  Bilateral standard true lateral views were also performed.  Sonographic imaging in all 4 quadrants, the retroareolar region, and axilla was also performed bilaterally. No suspicious masses, areas of concerning architectural distortion, or suspiciously clustered microcalcifications are identified. Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was performed.  This demonstrated benign appearing lymph nodes in the bilateral axillary regions.  In the left breast near the 12 o`clock position in the upper inner quadrant there is a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm complex cystic area 2 cm from the nipple.  This cystic structure is wider than tall and contains a small amount of soft tissue at its periphery.  No concerning solid masses identified. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT No suspicious mammographic findings in either breast to suggest malignancy.  The mildly complex cyst in the left breast is favored to be benign in etiology.

The previously detailed small nodular asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant persists on today`s additional mammographic images, best appreciated on the spot compression MLO view. Focused right breast ultrasound was performed.  In the upper outer quadrant/axillary tail, there are small benign appearing lymph nodes.  A small minimally complex cystic area is also noted in the upper outer quadrant near the 12 o`clock position 3-4 cm from the nipple measuring approximately 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm.  No concerning solid masses. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Comparison None available.  This is considered a baseline examination. Findings No concerning microcalcifications or architectural distortion are seen.  Within the anterior subareolar right breast there is a asymmetric density measuring approximately 8 x 9 x 8 mm.  Within the anterior slightly inferior medial left breast there is a 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm asymmetry. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Bilateral breast asymmetries.

If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Multiple left and right breast asymmetries.

Comparison January 30 2020, December 4 2018, December 1 2017, November 29 2016 Findings Within the posterosuperior lateral right breast there is a 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm asymmetry. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Posterosuperior lateral right breast asymmetry.

Women with a 15-20% calculated lifetime risk are considered at an intermediate risk for developing primary breast cancer. Based on ACR appropriateness criteria, the intermediate risk category lists annual screening MRI exams of the breasts with and without contrast as May Be Appropriate, as a complement to but not instead of annual screening mammogram exams.

The patient`s mother was diagnosed at age 62.  The patient`s sister was diagnosed at age 67 with triple negative breast cancer..  Personal history of bilateral reduction mammoplasty in 1985, approximately 36 years ago.  Prior benign breast biopsy in 1980, approximately 41 years ago. COMPARISON: November 3, 2016, November 21, 2017, November 27, 2018, and January 24, 2020 FINDINGS: Calculated NCI lifetime risk: 17.6% The breast parenchymal pattern is primarily almost entirely fatty.  No suspicious calcifications or masses. There are no suspicious findings to suggest malignancy when compared with prior exams.  Changes of prior bilateral reduction mammoplasty are subtle.\\r\\n\""]}

History of benign right breast cyst excision in 1980, approximately 41 years ago.  No family history of breast or ovarian cancer. COMPARISON: December 30, 2010, January 17, 2012, April 2, 2013, February 24, 2015, May 26, 2016, June 22, 2016, July 26, 2017, November 2, 2018, November 26, 2019, and December 17, 2020 FINDINGS: The breast parenchymal pattern is primarily scattered areas of fibroglandular density.  The increased density compared with older exams in 2010 through 2013 is likely from the hormone replacement therapy, physiologic and also unchanged by more short-term follow-up since exams 2015 and forward.  No suspicious calcifications or masses. At the area of concern, with magnification/compression, the calcifications in question are typically benign and the area of asymmetry compresses similar to the surrounding breast tissue without underlying mass.  No further imaging follow-up is therefore indicated at this time..\\r\\n\""]}

Implant displaced views.  3D Tomographic imaging with reconstructions. Comparison No priors could be obtained.  This will be read as a new baseline. Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen.  The implants appear to be intact. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Comparison None available.  Priors in Alabama have not arrived after greater than 2 weeks.  This will be read as a new baseline. Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen.  There is an intramammary lymph node seen within the superolateral posterior left breast. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Potential need for repeat biopsy and/or surgical referral also discussed with the patient. Patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Formal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure to verify patient, site, and procedure. \\n\\nOverlying skin of the right breast was aseptically prepared and sterile towels were placed. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were employed and maintained throughout the procedure. The skin and deeper soft tissues were locally anesthetized with 2-3 cc 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 14 gauge automatic Inrad core biopsy needle without introducer was placed  and a total of 4 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate. \\n\\nHydromark HM1 (closed coil)  localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy. \\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy right CC and ML digital mammogram demonstrates the clip in appropriate position.\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the Breast Center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions. Patient was discharged with ice pack to minimize risk of post biopsy hematoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 4, suspicious.\\n1.  Technically successful ultrasound guided core biopsy of suspicious mass right breast 6:00 middle depth. Hydromark HM1 (closed coil) tissue marker is felt to be in appropriate position. \\n2.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. At the 3 o`clock position 4 cm from the nipple in the left breast there is a hypoechoic well-circumscribed wider than tall smoothly marginated complicated cyst or small nodule measuring 3 x 2 x 3 mm.  This is not significantly changed in size for nearly 2 years.  At the 9 o`clock position 4 cm from the nipple there is a hypoechoic wider than tall smoothly marginated nonshadowing 9 calcified complicated cyst or nodule measuring 3 x 3 x 2 mm.  This is unchanged since most recent prior examination. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Probably benign left breast nodules or cysts.

Ultrasound of the right breast focal to the subareolar region. Comparison February 13 2020, April 8 2019, January 22 2018, January 18 2017, January 4 2016 Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. On ultrasound there is subareolar ductal dilatation.  Minimal debris is seen within a small duct.  No mass is detected.  No architectural distortion is seen. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Right subareolar ductal dilatation with mild debris.  No mass detected.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Ultrasound images demonstrate normal breast parenchyma.  No mass or architectural distortion is detected. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

COMPARISON 2016, 2018, 2020 TISSUE DENSITY DENSITYCODE:  C heterogeneously dense (51-75%) FINDINGS Standard bilateral CC, MLO, and true lateral views were performed.  Focused bilateral breast ultrasound also performed. Bilateral scattered areas of parenchymal asymmetry are again noted, similar to the previous exam from May 2020.  No suspicious masses, areas of concerning architectural distortion, or suspiciously clustered microcalcifications are identified. Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Focused bilateral breast ultrasound was performed.  In the retroareolar, lower inner, lower outer, and upper outer quadrants of the right breast, there are scattered areas of mildly complex cystic change which appears similar to previous studies.  Scattered mildly complex cystic change in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast again noted.  No new concerning solid masses.  Clip from prior benign left breast near the 6 o`clock position. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Bilateral breast asymmetries and scattered areas of mildly complex cystic change, favored to be benign in etiology.

Focused right breast ultrasound performed.  Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system.  Bilateral scattered areas of fibrocystic change are again noted, with 2 prominent cyst having increased in size compared to the previous study.  The largest cyst on the left measures approximately 2.5 x 2 cm in greatest dimensions.  At the site of marked palpable abnormality in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast near the nipple there is enlargement of a cyst measuring approximately 2.5 x 1.3 cm, which appears to correspond to the palpable abnormality. Focused right breast ultrasound was performed.  This demonstrated scattered areas of complex cystic change throughout the upper inner and lower inner quadrants, most of which are similar to the previous study.  The simple cyst in the retroareolar breast has increased in size measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.6 cm, corresponding to the reported palpable nodule.  No new solid nodules identified. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Bilateral fibrocystic change with 1 enlarging cyst in the right breast appearing to correspond to the palpable abnormality. Recommendation: Appropriate clinical management/follow-up of the patient`s palpable abnormality which appears to correspond to a benign simple cyst.  Unless there is an indication for a sooner return visit, the patient should return in 1 year for routine annual screening mammography.

Patient unable to stand, with examination performed in a wheelchair. This limits optimal positioning and inclusion of posterior tissue. In addition, spot magnification and compression views were unable to be performed secondary to patient physical limitations and unit limitations. \\n\\nCLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 74-year-old female recalled from screening mammogram 8/22/2019 for left breast focal asymmetry and architectural distortion, with associated calcifications. Patient returned for additional diagnostic evaluation. Upon further questioning, patient with remote left breast biopsy in 2013 complicated by development of large postprocedural hematoma and/or fat necrosis immediately following the biopsy. Outside ultrasound dated 12/18/2013 demonstrates large 3.4 cm mixed echogenic collection left breast 2:00, decreased in size from 6.6 cm collection with internal echogenicity/septations March 2013. These findings are in the area current mammographic concern.\\n\\nCOMPARISON: 8/22/2019.

Probably benign left mammogram. Limited examination as above.\\n2.  Probably benign left breast focal asymmetry and loosely grouped calcifications, likely related to evolving large postbiopsy hematoma/fat necrosis changes.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION:\\nRecommend short-term 3 month mammographic follow-up as current examination is somewhat limited as described above. The findings are stable in 3 months, additional 3 month follow-up could be performed to establish current six-month stability.\\n\\nFindings and recommendations were discussed with the patient at the conclusion of the examination, and a written report provided.

History of previous trauma and surgical abscess drainage in the area of palpable concern. TECHNIQUE Diagnostic left and right mammogram with CC, MLO, and lateral view.  Diagnostic left ultrasound focal to the area of palpable concern. Comparison Ultrasound November 15 2019, September 9 2019.  Mammogram September 9 2019, November 17 2015, June 13 2014 Findings There is interval development of an irregular mass with adjacent architectural changes in the left breast which measures 4.6 x 5 by 4.4 cm and corresponds to the area of palpable concern.  No concerning microcalcifications are detected. On ultrasound there is a hypoechoic irregular mass which demonstrates increased internal blood flow located at the 1:00 position 7 cm from the left nipple.  No axillary adenopathy is seen. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION A complicated history is given including prior trauma and drainage of an abscess in the area of palpable concern.  The mammographic and ultrasound appearance is highly concerning for neoplasia.  A biopsy was previously recommended of a lesion in this area and miss Allen states that she presented for biopsy at an outside facility but this was not visible at that time.  She did not return for recommended follow-up imaging.  Fat necrosis or scarring from previous surgery are less likely differential considerations.  Primary surgical excision or ultrasound-guided biopsy is recommended. I discussed these findings and recommendations with Ms. Allen.  She understands that this could represent neoplasia and intends to return for biopsy.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Patient agrees to proceed. Timeout procedure was followed to check patient`s name, birthdate and site of procedure.\\n\\nThe LEFT breast was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.\\nFormal final timeout was performed to verify the patient, correct site, and correct procedure. The LEFT breast was confirmed and marked with R or L for laterality. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique was followed.\\n  \\nOverlying skin of the LEFT  breast was aseptically prepared and skin locally anesthetized 3 cc 2% lidocaine solution at the needle entrance site. With ultrasound guidance, a 7 cm  Q- wire was then introduced into breast below the localization clip deployed at the time of outside biopsy. Second wire was deployed however the patient exhibited excruciating pain and wire was removed. Wire was secured. 2 view mammogram was then obtained.\\n\\nPOST PROCEDURE MAMMOGRAM: Post wire placement digital mammogram LEFT CC and ML obtained. Localization clip is present adjacent to the Q portion of the hook wire. Surgical excision is to extend generously around on the tip of the hook wire.

There is suggestion of a 5 mm rounded mass approximately 5 cm from the right nipple on the right CC view laterally probably localized to the right upper outer quadrant.  Further evaluation of the right breast is recommended with special mammograms and ultrasound.. A biopsy clip is noted on the left MLO view posteriorly but it is not included on the current CC view even though it was demonstrated previously.  Additional imaging of the left breast is recommended to attempt to include the area of the biopsy marker clip on the left. If there are any old mammogram studies done between 2012 and the current exam, it is recommended that these be brought forth for comparison.\\r\\n\""]}

The right breast was immobilized. Following localization sequences include precontrast axial T1 fat-sat followed by 2 sequential postcontrast sequences. Localization was performed with the assistance of the Dynacad program. \\n\\nPROCEDURE: The right breast was aseptically prepared. Localization grid applied with light compression. Skin was locally anesthetized with 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate and deeper anesthesia with spinal needle utilizing lidocaine with epinephrine at both targeted sample sites. Introducers were advanced to the appropriate depth followed by localization sequence. Bard 10 gauge vacuum assisted needle was placed and a total of 6 samples obtained at both sites posterior and subsequently anterior. Following sampling,  post biopsy sequences performed demonstrating adequate/representative sampling. \\n\\nMR-compatible M-shaped clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy cavity, lateral right breast posterior; SITE A.\\nMR-compatible X-shaped clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy cavity, lateral right breast anterior; SITE B.\\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to both entry sites and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy right CC and ML digital mammogram demonstrates the localization clips in position, with some degree of medial migration; distance between the clips 3.7 cm mammographically spanning from 8:00-10:00 and corresponding well with the targeted nonmass enhancement on breast MR.\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the breast center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions.

Diagnostic targeted left breast ultrasound CLINICAL INFORMATION: 44 y/o  F presenting for follow-up of palpable abnormality left breast.  Patient states no significant change for at least 2 years. COMPARISON: June 4, 2019 mammogram, ultrasound January 16, 2020, June 4, 2019, November 30, 2018, October 16, 2018 TECHNIQUE: 1. Diagnostic digital mammogram, standard lateral, cc and MLO tomographic views with synthetic reconstructions were obtained. 2. Diagnostic targeted left breast ultrasound performed in a real-time by the sonographer under the direction of the radiologist. FINDINGS: DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM: Mammographic pattern is heterogenously dense which may obscure small masses.  There are scattered typically benign calcifications in both breasts.  Palpable marker is present over the inferior left breast near the 6 o`clock position approximately 2 cm from the nipple.  No mass, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications identified. Please see additional sonographic findings further detailed below. BREAST ULTRASOUND: Targeted ultrasound of the lateral left breast and retroareolar left breast was performed.  Multiple scattered cysts and ductal dilatation are not significantly changed since at least 2018, consistent with benign etiology.  In the area of palpable concern, clustered cyst at the 6 o`clock position 3 cm from the nipple measures 9 mm.  No solid mass, parenchymal distortion or suspicious sonographic findings.\\r\\n\""]}

Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Tomosynthesis images demonstrate no additional findings. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system.  The computer detection system revealed a negative result. A negative/benign mammographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings.

FINDINGS: DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM: Mammographic pattern is fatty replaced.  Oval circumscribed mass in the upper inner right breast far posterior depth measures 5 mm located approximately 21 cm from the nipple.  No architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications identified. Please see additional sonographic findings further detailed below. BREAST ULTRASOUND: Targeted ultrasound of the upper inner right breast was performed.  At the 1-2:00 position approximately 20 cm from the nipple, oval circumscribed hypoechoic mass centered just deep to the skin surface with cutaneous tract demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement and measures 5 x 4 x 2 mm.

Comparison January 3 2013 Findings There is a new group calcifications seen the posterosuperior lateral right breast. No concerning mass, or architectural distortion is seen. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION New group microcalcifications seen within the superolateral posterior right breast.  Recommend magnification views and lateral view.

History: Right breast asymmetry and complex cystic change follow-up.  The patient reports a draining area in the left axillary region which has intermittently been present in the past. COMPARISON 2011, 2013-2019 TISSUE DENSITY DENSITYCODE:  B Scattered fibroglandular densities (25-50%) FINDINGS Standard bilateral CC, MLO, true lateral views were performed.  Focused right breast ultrasound and left axillary ultrasound also performed. No suspicious masses, areas of concerning architectural distortion, or suspiciously clustered microcalcifications are identified.  At the site of marked palpable abnormality in the left axillary region there is a 1 cm nodule.  Compared to prior exams, there has been no suspicious mammographic change.   Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system.  The computer detection system revealed a negative result. Focused right breast ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a small mildly complex cystic area in the upper outer quadrant near the 9 o`clock position 4 cm from the nipple measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.  This is not significantly changed dating back to exams from November 2018.  At the site of palpable abnormality in the left axillary region there is a subcutaneous 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.9 cm complex cystic area with slight surrounding hyperechogenicity. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Stable complex cystic change in the right breast, consistent with a benign etiology.  The palpable abnormality in the left axillary region is consistent with a sebaceous cyst given the imaging appearance and the patient`s clinical history. Recommendation: Appropriate clinical management/follow-up of the patient`s left axillary sebaceous cyst.  Unless there is a clinical indication for a sooner return visit, the patient should return in 1 year for routine annual screening mammography.

Diagnostic targeted left breast ultrasound performed in a real-time by the sonographer under the direction of the radiologist. FINDINGS: DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM: Mammographic pattern is heterogenously dense which may obscure small masses.  Circumscribed oval mass in the upper inner left breast near the 10 o`clock position approximately 8 cm from the nipple measures 7 mm.  No architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications identified. Please see additional sonographic findings further detailed below. BREAST ULTRASOUND: Targeted ultrasound of the medial left breast was performed.  At the 10 o`clock position approximately 8 cm from the nipple, there are circumscribed simple cysts measuring 4 mm and 6 mm, correlating with mammographic findings.  Additional simple cyst at the 11 o`clock position 6 cm from the nipple measuring 6 mm.  No solid mass, parenchymal distortion or suspicious sonographic findings.\\r\\n\""]}

Results will be communicated by mail.  An annual screening reminder will be sent by mail. Report dictation location: HCRADDS1\\r\\nEXAM DESCRIPTION: MAMMO SCREENING BILATERAL INCL CAD CLINICAL INFORMATION: Breast cancer screening by mammogram .  Positive sister family history of breast cancer diagnosed at age 42.

Potential need for repeat biopsy and/or surgical referral also discussed with the patient. Patient agrees to proceed. No medical conditions at this time to prevent percutaneous needle biopsy. Formal timeout was performed prior to beginning procedure to verify patient, site, and procedure. \\n\\nOverlying skin of the left breast was aseptically prepared and sterile towels were placed. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were employed and maintained throughout the procedure. The skin and deeper soft tissues were locally anesthetized with 2-3 cc 2% lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate. A small skin nick was made with a #11 surgical blade. With ultrasound guidance, a 14 gauge automatic Inrad core biopsy needle without introducer was placed  and a total of 4 biopsy specimens obtained. These were considered  adequate. \\n\\nHydromark HM3 (open coil)  localization clip was deployed at the site of the biopsy. \\n\\nManual pressure was held until adequate hemostasis was achieved. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the site and a sterile bandage placed.\\n\\nThe samples were labeled and sealed, and information was verified with the patient including correct name, site, and laterality.\\n\\nPOST BIOPSY MAMMOGRAM: Post biopsy left CC and MLO digital mammogram demonstrates the clip in expected position, left breast 6:00 anterior depth/subareolar region.\\n\\nNo immediate post-procedural complications. Patient was released from the Breast Center in good condition and with written postbiopsy instructions. Patient was discharged with ice pack to minimize risk of post biopsy hematoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: BI-RADS 4, suspicious.\\n1.  Technically successful ultrasound guided core biopsy of suspicious mass left breast 6:00 anterior depth/upper lumbar region.

With spot compression, the previous area of mammographic concern is not identified on today`s exam.  Exaggerated lateral CC view shows no CC view correlate.  However, dense breast tissue in this region persists.  Ultrasound evaluation is therefore indicated and is performed subsequently same day, reported below. Targeted ultrasound evaluation of the upper outer quadrant of the left breast.  Dense breast tissue is demonstrated without suspicious abnormality sonographically.

COMPARISON 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 TISSUE DENSITY DENSITYCODE:  B Scattered fibroglandular densities (25-50%) FINDINGS Standard true lateral view and spot compression CC and MLO views of the right breast were performed.  Focused bilateral breast ultrasound also performed. The previously detailed right breast asymmetry in the retroareolar breast on the CC view persists on today`s additional spot compression CC view.  This is not definitively identified on the true lateral view or MLO spot compression view.  Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. Focused bilateral breast ultrasound was performed.  This demonstrated stable complex cystic change in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast near the 9 o`clock position as well as in the upper outer and retroareolar left breast dating back to exams from May 2018.  No new concerning findings.  Specifically, no new findings in the right breast to correspond to the asymmetry seen mammographically. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT Stable bilateral complex cystic change, consistent with a benign etiology.  The right breast asymmetry on the recent screening mammogram is favored to be benign in etiology as no corresponding sonographic abnormalities were identified. Recommendation: The patient should return in 6 months for diagnostic right mammogram to document stability of the asymmetry.

A true lateral view of the right breast and spot compression MLO view of the right breast were also performed.  Focused right breast ultrasound performed.  Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. The previously detailed small nodule in the slightly inferior right breast is not significantly changed mammographically.  In the superior right breast on the MLO view only, there is an area of asymmetrically dense tissue which faintly persists on the spot compression MLO view.  No concerning interval changes in the left breast. Focused right breast ultrasound was performed.  In the superior breast, no sonographic abnormalities are identified to correspond to the asymmetry seen mammographically.  In the lower outer quadrant there is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm hyperechoic nodule which appears similar to the previous exam from December 2019.  No new sonographic abnormalities. A negative/benign mammographic/ultrasonographic report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. ASSESSMENT The previously detailed right breast nodule is stable sonographically and favored to be benign in etiology.  There is a new right breast asymmetry in the superior breast with no corresponding sonographic abnormality and is also favored to be benign in etiology. Recommendation: The patient should return in 6 months for diagnostic right mammogram to document stability of the new right breast asymmetry.  Follow-up ultrasound in 1 year at the time of bilateral mammography is also recommended to document a total of 2 year stability of the right breast nodule.

Patient is requesting diagnostic follow-up of right breast one year after surgery.\\n\\nHistory of right breast ultrasound-guided biopsy 12:00, 3 cm from the nipple with benign pathology (proliferative fibrocystic change, sclerosing adenosis and usual ductal hyperplasia). This area was felt to change on subsequent exams, 6/19/2019 MR was performed and the lesion at 12:00 3 cm from the nipple with suspicious characteristics. An additional area of nonmass enhancement in the right breast found on this MRI at the 6:00 position 2 cm from the nipple was subsequently MR biopsied as benign concordant (fibrocystic change, florid ductal hyperplasia) on 7/3/2019. \\n\\nThe patient was referred for surgical excision, discordance of 12:00 lesion.\\n\\nThe patient then underwent right breast seed localization lumpectomy and subareolar duct excision on 7/16/2019, patient reports benign surgical pathology. \\n\\n No family history of breast or ovarian carcinoma. \\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Screening digital mammogram with DIGITAL BREAST TOMOSYNTHESIS (3-D MAMMOGRAPHY) of both breast(s) was obtained.   \\nThis mammogram was analyzed by a CAD (Computer-Aided Detection) system. \\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Prior outside studies studies: 6/6/2019, 7/3/2019, 7/16/2019 mammograms, right breast ultrasound dated 6/25/2019, bilateral breast MRI dated 6/19/2019, MR biopsy right breast dated 7/3/2019 Mayo Hospital Breast Ctr.

The left breast is otherwise stable.\\n\\nA superior periareolar scar marker has been placed on the right breast. When compared to mammogram dated 7/3/2019 there has been removal of a heart shaped clip near the 12 to 1:00 position middle depth (site of seed localization/surgical excision). There is subtle expected postsurgical parenchymal change, no suspicious features. Persistent cylinder-shaped tissue marker right breast 6:00 position anterior to middle depth (MR biopsy, benign).\\n\\nThere is no dominant mass, abnormal calcification, suspicious asymmetry or unexpected distortion in either breast, no mammographic or tomographic finding to suggest malignancy.  \\n\\nIMPRESSION: Benign mammogram.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: Routine annual screening mammography, preferably with tomosynthesis. \\n\\nThe mammogram reveals heterogeneously dense or dense breast tissue. Tennessee law effective 1/1/2014 now requires we inform your patient by letter of her mammographic breast density and encourages her to discuss this issue with you.

The procedure, benefits, and risks, including pain, bleeding, infection, and need for wire repositioning/replacement were discussed with the patient.  The patient expressed understanding and informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. A formal timeout was performed prior to beginning the procedure to verify correct patient, site, and procedure being performed. \\n\\nThe previously biopsied asymmetry and associated well-hydrated Hydromark clip identified sonographically. The overlying skin was aseptically prepared and maximal sterile barrier technique employed throughout the procedure. A 2% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the skin and deeper tissue. With ultrasound guidance, a 7 cm Q wire and needle were advanced along the anterior and posterior margins of the targeted asymmetry containing the localization clip.

General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer.

Comparison February 27 2019, September 28 2018, October 20 2016, August 18 2015, July 20 2014, April 16 2013 Findings A 6 x 4 mm nodule is seen within the slightly lateral anterior right breast.  There are calcifications within the posterolateral right breast which were not seen on previous examination.  These could correspond to calcifications within the inferior or superior posterior right breast, possibly vascular origin. Multiple asymmetries are seen within the left middle and posterior depth left breast in the medial, lateral, central, and superior left breast. No architectural distortion is detected. Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Bilateral breast asymmetries.  New right breast calcifications.  Recommend spot compression imaging and lateral view of the breast asymmetries with p.r.n. ultrasound.  Recommend magnification and lateral views of the breast calcifications.
