Ultrasound of the right breast focal to the areas of previous concern. Comparison January 20 2020, July 17 2019, January 16 2019, July 10 2018 Findings Benign appearing calcifications are seen. No concerning mass, architectural distortion, or microcalcification is seen. The well-circumscribed hypoechoic lesion seen 1 cm from the nipple at the 11:00 position appears to be stable for greater than 2 years and is likely benign.  At the 3 o`clock position there is a 2 x 3 x 3 mm possibly septated cyst which has been stable for 18 months.  This is 3 cm from the nipple.  There is a stable 3 x 3 x 2 mm fibrocystic nodule 3 cm from the nipple at the 3 o`clock position.  At the 9:00 position there is a stable complicated septated cystic lesion unchanged for greater than 2 years which is 9 x 7 x 3 mm located 2 cm from the nipple.  No concerning interval changes seen. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased. In patients with a significant family history of breast cancer, MRI may offer increased sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer. IMPRESSION Probably benign complicated cysts again seen within the right breast.  No significant change in the appearance of the mammogram.  Follow-up ultrasound is recommended in 6 months to evaluate the cystic areas that have been stable for 18 months.

Tomographic images and reconstructions concur. Films were reviewed by R2 computer-assisted detection system. General Recommendations: A negative/benign report should not delay or preclude biopsy in the setting of suspicious clinical findings. If the patient has not had a recent physical examination of the breasts, it is suggested that an appointment be made with the clinician for physical exam correlation. In patients with dense or heterogeneously dense breast tissue, the sensitivity of mammography may be decreased.
